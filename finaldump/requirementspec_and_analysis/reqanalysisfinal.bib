abstract = {Developing VR applications is a challenging and rewarding endeavor, complicated by the variety and complexity of the available VR platforms. Furthermore, efficiencies realized in a specific platform may be lost if the application is migrated to a different platform. In this paper, we introduce and investigate the Common Scene Definition Framework (CSDF), a modeling representation consisting of a superset of capabilities taken from a collection of existing VR platforms. The purpose of CSDF is to serve a quick prototype framework for synthesizing an interactive virtual environment for a particular platform while attempting to optimize the translation to leverage strengths of the target platform. In an implementation independent fashion, the CSDF is envisioned to extensibly represent all geometry, appearance, interaction, and behavior for a VR application. Finally, an example is provided demonstration these basic ideas among the VRML 1.0, VRML97 and Java3D platforms.},

abstract = {This paper relates to the problems of designing rich interaction, in the context of multi-player games, that would adequately support communication, control and co-ordination. The aspects of fun and rich experiences, usually required within the entertainment context, are easily overlooked in technologically driven system design. The concepts of a future ubiquitous game can be difficult to comprehend and evaluate in cases where a fully functioning physical prototype is not an option. One solution for the problem is Contextual Virtual Reality Prototyping that adds the missing context to the design simulations. The product can be designed and demonstrated in the corresponding environment, thus making it easier to understand the use-cases of, for example, a mobile device that has various location-dependent features. The main contribution of this research is the design and development approach that supports the creation of rich interaction. The primary emphasis of the approach is to avoid purely technologically driven design and development, but rather to provide a supporting, or even a guiding, approach that focuses on the creative process and conceptual understanding of rich interaction. This conceptually grounded content production-oriented approach to interactive system design is described and evaluated.},
