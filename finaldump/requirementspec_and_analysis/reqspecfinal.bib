abstract = {User interfaces that leverages vivid computer graphics and virtual reality technologies provide effective means for exploring and inspecting cultural artifacts. Such virtual inspection systems help experience and disseminate cultural heritage. For such systems to be truly ubiquitous, they need to expose a user-friendly interface that an untrained population can find intuitive and engaging. In this paper, we present one such mixed reality (MR) based interaction system that can be used to visualize as well as explore cultural heritage. The system is demonstrated by an interactive exploration of 15th century 'Vittala Temple' located at a UNESCO world heritage site, Hampi. Our system investigates the augmentation of computer generated imagery with a physical replica to increase immersion and awareness. It uses monoscopic projection mapping on the 3D-printed replica laid out on a tabletop along with a vertical projection wall behind the tabletop, on which a 3D-rendered view is displayed. Projection on the physical layout is synchronized with the 3D rendering to allow projection of texture, navigation path, users current position, etc. on the tabletop. Users can interact with this system by simply waving a laser pointer to select structures or to define a path. We have additionally explored the benefit of using a steering wheel to further control the camera direction. Such a system creates and maintains a semantic relation between users actions and the resulting effect. The UI enables two major functionalities: interactive inspection of an architectural complex and the multimedia data attached to various components and artifacts.},

abstract = {Many people with dementia (PwD) often have serious problems with basic everyday motor-cognitive tasks such as brushing their teeth, grasping objects, putting clothes on, or communicating with others. The challenges of these daily activities increase over time for PwD, but can be opposed with regular exercises. Virtual reality (VR) exergames have enormous potential to provide virtual scenarios, which could potentially reduce the progress of neuronal degeneration by motivating PwD to train their daily routines.In this work-in-progress (w.i.p.) paper, we introduce the concept and development of a VR exergame for PwD. This VR exergame provides personalized motor-cognitive therapy for performing actions of daily routines in a gamified scenario. The focus is to create suitable exercises and further evaluate their completion to provide an optimal training scenario for improving everyday skills of PwD. Finally, we discuss the implications and next steps of this project.},

abstract = {Overcoming a range of challenges that traditional therapy faces, VRET yields great potential for the treatment of phobias such as acrophobia, the fear of heights. We investigate this potential and present playful user-generated treatment (PUT), a novel game-based approach for VRET. Based on a requirement analysis consisting of a literature review and semi-structured interviews with professional therapists, we designed and implemented the PUT concept as a two-step VR game design. To validate our approach, we conducted two studies. (1) In a study with 31 non-acrophobic subjects, we investigated the effect of content creation on player experience, motivation and height perception, and (2) in an online survey, we collected feedback from professional therapists. Both studies reveal that the PUT approach is well applicable. In particular, the analysis of the user study shows that the design phase leads to increased interest and enjoyment without notably influencing affective measures during the exposure session. Our work can help guiding researchers and practitioners at the intersection of game design and exposure therapy.},
