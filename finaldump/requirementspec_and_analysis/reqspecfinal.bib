abstract = {User interfaces that leverages vivid computer graphics and virtual reality technologies provide effective means for exploring and inspecting cultural artifacts. Such virtual inspection systems help experience and disseminate cultural heritage. For such systems to be truly ubiquitous, they need to expose a user-friendly interface that an untrained population can find intuitive and engaging. In this paper, we present one such mixed reality (MR) based interaction system that can be used to visualize as well as explore cultural heritage. The system is demonstrated by an interactive exploration of 15th century 'Vittala Temple' located at a UNESCO world heritage site, Hampi. Our system investigates the augmentation of computer generated imagery with a physical replica to increase immersion and awareness. It uses monoscopic projection mapping on the 3D-printed replica laid out on a tabletop along with a vertical projection wall behind the tabletop, on which a 3D-rendered view is displayed. Projection on the physical layout is synchronized with the 3D rendering to allow projection of texture, navigation path, users current position, etc. on the tabletop. Users can interact with this system by simply waving a laser pointer to select structures or to define a path. We have additionally explored the benefit of using a steering wheel to further control the camera direction. Such a system creates and maintains a semantic relation between users actions and the resulting effect. The UI enables two major functionalities: interactive inspection of an architectural complex and the multimedia data attached to various components and artifacts.},

abstract = {Many people with dementia (PwD) often have serious problems with basic everyday motor-cognitive tasks such as brushing their teeth, grasping objects, putting clothes on, or communicating with others. The challenges of these daily activities increase over time for PwD, but can be opposed with regular exercises. Virtual reality (VR) exergames have enormous potential to provide virtual scenarios, which could potentially reduce the progress of neuronal degeneration by motivating PwD to train their daily routines.In this work-in-progress (w.i.p.) paper, we introduce the concept and development of a VR exergame for PwD. This VR exergame provides personalized motor-cognitive therapy for performing actions of daily routines in a gamified scenario. The focus is to create suitable exercises and further evaluate their completion to provide an optimal training scenario for improving everyday skills of PwD. Finally, we discuss the implications and next steps of this project.},

abstract = {Overcoming a range of challenges that traditional therapy faces, VRET yields great potential for the treatment of phobias such as acrophobia, the fear of heights. We investigate this potential and present playful user-generated treatment (PUT), a novel game-based approach for VRET. Based on a requirement analysis consisting of a literature review and semi-structured interviews with professional therapists, we designed and implemented the PUT concept as a two-step VR game design. To validate our approach, we conducted two studies. (1) In a study with 31 non-acrophobic subjects, we investigated the effect of content creation on player experience, motivation and height perception, and (2) in an online survey, we collected feedback from professional therapists. Both studies reveal that the PUT approach is well applicable. In particular, the analysis of the user study shows that the design phase leads to increased interest and enjoyment without notably influencing affective measures during the exposure session. Our work can help guiding researchers and practitioners at the intersection of game design and exposure therapy.},

abstract = {The design of complex manufacturing systems (CMSs) is challenging, because of the requirements of efficiency, safety, and ergonomics, and the need of optimizing resources, i.e., space, machines, operators, and data. Virtual reality (VR) – one of the promising technologies at the base of Industry 4.0 – is able to address the design issues of CMSs, and even decrease costs and time when employed from the initial conception to the final validation of production lines, since it facilitates their virtual commissioning, i.e., it enables the full verification of systems and related components by virtual inspection and tests. Despite the above advantages, VR is still rarely used in the design of CMSs, and there is no standard VR approach in industry yet. In addition, the related scientific literature is scarce and often limited to small or simplified cases. To fill this gap, this work presents a novel VR-based approach for designing CMSs, composed of four phases: Three-dimensional CAD Export, Model Import, Scene Creation, and VR Review. The proposed approach is applied to a real industrial use case related to the virtual commissioning of an electric axles production line and it is evaluated through a questionnaire from industry professionals. The case study shows that using the VR technology enhanced the technical communication between experts in the teamwork, and it was particularly effective in finding ergonomics flaws like issues in visibility, reach, and posture using a virtual golden zone. In addition, all users found the VR interaction enjoyable and easy to learn, and beginner users perceived a comparable workload as advanced users.}

Yet, these devices are still rarely used in practice and it remains an open challenge how to move this research into practice. To that end, we contribute a participatory design study on the use of haptic feedback devices in the automotive industry. Based on a 10-month observing process with 13 engineers, we developed STRIVE, a string-based haptic feedback device. In addition to the design of STRIVE, this process led to a set of requirements for introducing haptic devices into industrial settings, which center around a need for flexibility regarding forces, comfort, and mobility. We evaluated STRIVE with 16 engineers in five different day-to-day automotive VR use cases. The main results show an increased level of trust and perceived safety as well as further challenges towards moving haptics research into practice.},

abstract = {Immersive technologies push the boundaries of virtual reality games. In particular, input controllers play an important role for such a player experience. With regard to first-person shooters, a well-crafted controller that resembles its virtual counterpart can increase the feeling of presence. Though controllers often resemble gun handles or even two-handed rifles, the in-game weapon switching is not reflected in the physical controller. That is, swapping a tiny blaster for a big laser rifle does not alter the haptics and the behavior of the device, restricting the feeling of presence. Our contribution closes that gap and enhances the player experience by introducing the concept of a self-transforming controller. The controller adapts to the current virtual weapon by transforming between a pistol-like controller and a two-handed rifle-like device. We evaluated the concept by comparing the self-transforming controller to a state-of-the-art device. The results show a significant improvement in the player experience in terms of appearance, authenticity, efficiency, experienced realism, and flow.},

abstract = {This paper takes the cruise passenger cabin as the research object, builds the virtual environment model according to the relevant theoretical knowledge and materials, introduces and studies the theory of ergonomic design evaluation, establishes the human-machine environment evaluation index system and comprehensive evaluation model of the cruise passenger cabin, introduces several common comprehensive evaluation methods, compares the advantages and disadvantages of different methods, and combines them with this design object so as to select the applicable evaluation method to evaluate the cabin design scheme. It also introduces several common comprehensive evaluation methods, compares the advantages and disadvantages of different methods, combines them with the design object, so as to select the applicable evaluation methods to evaluate the cabin design scheme and make the cabin design evaluation more systematic, accurate, and reasonable, realizes the three-dimensional visualization of the cruise ship cabin based on virtual reality technology and other technologies, and conducts the ergonomic evaluation of the design effect. The relevant knowledge involved includes human-machine-environment system engineering theory, 3D modeling theory, hierarchical analysis theory, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation theory, and virtual reality development theory. The concept of intelligent environment design is introduced into the environmental design of the intelligent entertainment system of cruise ships, and after the systematic study of the user’s demand level and cabin environment design element system, the problems existing in it are handled and combined with intelligent products, the different functions of intelligence are classified and studied, and the different forms of control are specifically studied to provide the basis for the subsequent specific design. In the case study, an overall evaluation of the architectural aesthetics of the target ship was derived through evaluation experiments. Based on the results, specific indicators at different levels can be traced, thus providing guidance directions for optimal design. The methods such as fuzzy synthesis evaluation and the idea of integrating the evaluation process with VR experience adopted in this paper can provide reference ideas for similar studies.},

abstract = {User interfaces that leverages vivid computer graphics and virtual reality technologies provide effective means for exploring and inspecting cultural artifacts. Such virtual inspection systems help experience and disseminate cultural heritage. For such systems to be truly ubiquitous, they need to expose a user-friendly interface that an untrained population can find intuitive and engaging. In this paper, we present one such mixed reality (MR) based interaction system that can be used to visualize as well as explore cultural heritage. The system is demonstrated by an interactive exploration of 15th century 'Vittala Temple' located at a UNESCO world heritage site, Hampi. Our system investigates the augmentation of computer generated imagery with a physical replica to increase immersion and awareness. It uses monoscopic projection mapping on the 3D-printed replica laid out on a tabletop along with a vertical projection wall behind the tabletop, on which a 3D-rendered view is displayed. Projection on the physical layout is synchronized with the 3D rendering to allow projection of texture, navigation path, users current position, etc. on the tabletop. Users can interact with this system by simply waving a laser pointer to select structures or to define a path. We have additionally explored the benefit of using a steering wheel to further control the camera direction. Such a system creates and maintains a semantic relation between users actions and the resulting effect. The UI enables two major functionalities: interactive inspection of an architectural complex and the multimedia data attached to various components and artifacts.},
