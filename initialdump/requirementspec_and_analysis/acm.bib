abstract = {Software practitioners use various requirement elicitation methods to produce a well-defined product. These methods impact the software product’s eventual traits and target a particular audience segment. Virtual Reality(VR) products are no different from this influence. With the notable rise in product offerings across various domains, VR has become an essential technology for the future. Nevertheless, the type of methods practiced for requirement elicitation still has not been thoroughly studied. This paper presents a mapping study on requirement elicitation methods practiced by VR practitioners in academia and industry. We consolidated our observations based on their popularity in the practitioner community. Further, we present our insights on the necessary and sufficient conditions to conduct VR requirement elicitation using the identified methods to benefit the VR practitioner community.},

Given the software platform fragmentation and hardware volatility, there is an apparent disconnect among practitioners while building applications in the VR domain. This paper proposes a role-based model template as a meta-model to specify the bare minimum VR software system. We conducted a grounded-theory-based qualitative study on prevailing and phased-out VR SDKs and standards to propose this meta-model. This model template can help VR practitioners build open-source tools to develop, design, and test VR software systems.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging technique that provides immersive experience for users. Due to the high computation cost of rendering real-time animation twice (for both eyes) and the resource limitation of wearable devices, VR applications often face performance bottlenecks and performance optimization plays an important role in VR software development. Performance optimizations of VR applications can be very different from those in traditional software as VR involves more elements such as graphics rendering and real-time animation. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on 183 real-world performance optimizations from 45 VR software projects. In particular, we manually categorized the optimizations into 11 categories, and applied static analysis to identify how they affect different life-cycle phases of VR applications. Furthermore, we studied the complexity and design / behavior effects of performance optimizations, and how optimizations are different between large organizational software projects and smaller personal software projects. Our major findings include: (1) graphics simplification (24.0%), rendering optimization (16.9%), language / API optimization (15.3%), heap avoidance (14.8%), and value caching (12.0%) are the most common categories of performance optimization in VR applications; (2) game logic updates (30.4%) and before-scene initialization (20.0%) are the most common life-cycle phases affected by performance issues; (3) 45.9% of the optimizations have behavior and design effects and 39.3% of the optimizations are systematic changes; (4) the distributions of optimization classes are very different between organizational VR projects and personal VR projects.},

abstract = {High-fidelity driving simulators can act as testbeds for designing in-vehicle interfaces or validating the safety of novel driver assistance features. In this system paper, we develop and validate the safety of a mixed reality driving simulator system that enables us to superimpose virtual objects and events into the view of participants engaging in real-world driving in unmodified vehicles. To this end, we have validated the mixed reality system for basic driver cockpit and low-speed driving tasks, comparing the use of the system with non-headset and with the headset driving conditions, to ensure that participants behave and perform similarly using this system as they would otherwise. This paper outlines the operational procedures and protocols for using such systems for cockpit tasks (like using the parking brake, reading the instrument panel, and turn signaling) as well as basic low-speed driving exercises (such as steering around corners, weaving around obstacles, and stopping at a fixed line) in ways that are safe, effective, and lead to accurate, repeatable data collection about behavioral responses in real-world driving tasks.},

abstract = {Virtual reality technology is a research focus today, and has been applied to education, entertainment and many other fields. Computer hardware assembly is a course that teaches students how to recognize and assemble a computer. However, traditional teaching model has a series of problems, such as the slow update of computer training equipment, serious hardware waste and danger of assembly experiment process. In order to solve these problems, we designed and developed a virtual training system for computer hardware assembly (VTSCHA) based on the Unity3D platform. In the design stage, we fully considered the needs of the course and proposed a complete system architecture. Then through the study of Playmaker visual programming plug-in, animation and UI system, we respectively realized the parts display, computer assembly demonstration and computer simulation operation function, and finally completed the system. Practical results show that using VTSCHA can achieve a good teaching effect in the classroom. This system has good three-dimensional display and interactive functions. Learners can easily get started and operate in the virtual environment.},

abstract = {Overcoming a range of challenges that traditional therapy faces, VRET yields great potential for the treatment of phobias such as acrophobia, the fear of heights. We investigate this potential and present playful user-generated treatment (PUT), a novel game-based approach for VRET. Based on a requirement analysis consisting of a literature review and semi-structured interviews with professional therapists, we designed and implemented the PUT concept as a two-step VR game design. To validate our approach, we conducted two studies. (1) In a study with 31 non-acrophobic subjects, we investigated the effect of content creation on player experience, motivation and height perception, and (2) in an online survey, we collected feedback from professional therapists. Both studies reveal that the PUT approach is well applicable. In particular, the analysis of the user study shows that the design phase leads to increased interest and enjoyment without notably influencing affective measures during the exposure session. Our work can help guiding researchers and practitioners at the intersection of game design and exposure therapy.},

abstract = {We designed an immersive VR system to support the imagination of complex anatomical structures. By solving a 3D puzzle of anatomical models, medical students learn names and spatial relations. The approach is proposed as a supplement to the work with traditional human body donors. To meet the needs of medical students and satisfy the different stages of learning, the approach contains different modes that help the student to gather and review medical knowledge. Additionally, different feedback mechanisms that support the student with the puzzle task are proposed. The concept is realized as a prototype application using the HTC Vive and the Unity game engine. This prototype is evaluated in a pilot study, where we investigate the general usefulness as well as the feedback mechanisms. The results suggest that a 3D puzzle in a fully immersive virtual reality environment can be a valuable extension to traditional teaching methods in the medical curriculum. Regarding the feedback, it is clear that a combination of vibrotactile feedback and a ghost copy approach are most promising.},

abstract = {Current teleconsultation solutions for preclinical emergencies can transmit knowledge from a remote expert to a local paramedic using audio and 2D video channels. Such technology lacks precision and efficiency for medical diagnostic tasks, and visual feedback is often missing between participants. We investigate a mixed reality 3D teleconsultation solution for preclinical use, which provides a 3D reconstruction of the local scene to a remote expert, displayed in Virtual Reality. A remote expert can join the local scene virtually as an Augmented Reality avatar. The remote expert can annotate the local scene and guide the local paramedics through the procedure. We explored our system in a user study within a preclinical scenario on a collaborative task of attaching chest lead electrodes of a 12 channel electrocardiogram on a mannequin. We compared the 3D teleconsultation system to a 2D video-mediated teleconsultation via a top-mounted camera and report results from the consultee side in AR. Based on our empirical user study with 10 paramedics with an average of 17 years experience, we observe an improvement in the electrode placement quality using the 3D teleconsultation system. Results indicate no significant difference in the cognitive task-load between conditions. Participants perceived the video-mediated consultation as more usable due to their unfamiliarity with the 3D teleconsultation system. However, participants acknowledge the potential of 3D teleconsultation and believe such a system can significantly improve the preclinical treatment.},

Based on a 10-month observing process with 13 engineers, we developed STRIVE, a string-based haptic feedback device. In addition to the design of STRIVE, this process led to a set of requirements for introducing haptic devices into industrial settings, which center around a need for flexibility regarding forces, comfort, and mobility. We evaluated STRIVE with 16 engineers in five different day-to-day automotive VR use cases. The main results show an increased level of trust and perceived safety as well as further challenges towards moving haptics research into practice.},

It will lead to Internet addiction that can develop the abnormal user behavior, which may create cybercrime at one side or pornographic action and reduce physical activity in other side. In response to these and other concerns, several prevention or directive measure should take action immediately and concussively. Children may be prohibited by law from playing online games that require a resident registration number between midnight until early morning or through parental permission is required during the review process to understand how social media affects a child's well-being and how long the screen remains healthy. Essentially, the development of a healthy Internet platform should increase awareness among stakeholders about the consequences of Internet addiction, while at the same time encouraging the provision of appropriate and flexible strategies for its impact. Internet healthy means the attempt to promote the awareness among the user in order to preserve good physical and mental condition based on normal and desirable activity of very satisfactory amount in using Internet.},

The diagnosis relies on the observation of behavioural symptoms and parent reporting of the developmental history of the child. It requires years of experience and training for identifying these symptoms which could be often misjudged as other mental conditions with similar symptomology. In this work, we propose a robot-assisted diagnostic protocol for the early detection of autism leveraging the onboard sensors of Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) and the vast potential of machine learning techniques. The robot assistant's role will be two-fold: (a) supporting the expert in administering the diagnostic procedure and (b) evaluating the behavioural symptoms and reaching a reliable diagnosis. Even though similar studies have been done in the Global North, the challenges posed by the social and cultural diversity of the Indian population is varied and needs to be explored further.},

Some applications need low latency, whereas others need high bandwidth or security support. The goal of this paper is to identify the requirements and to understand the limitations for 5G driven applications. We review application areas and list the typical challenges and requirements posed on 5G networks. A main challenge will be to develop a network architecture being able to dynamically adapt to fluctuating traffic patterns and accommodating various technologies such as edge computing, blockchain based distributed ledger, software defined networking, and virtualization. To inspire future research, we reveal open problems and highlight the need for piloting with 5G applications, with tangible steps, to understand the configuration of 5G networks and the use of applications across multiple vertical industries.},

In the field of education, it can be used as an alternative control method and provides accessibility for users when used in human computer interface solutions. With mobile devices which has internal inertial sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, a head movement control method has been developed to determine the movements that can be used to navigate the application. This method changes the function of hand-based input into head-based. The combination of Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) with mobile devices, provide an innovation of new low cost of human-computer interaction. It can be used with six type of head poses movement; move to the left, move to the right, head looking down, head looking up, tilt head toward left shoulder, and tilt head toward right shoulder. In this study, we concern to design head poses movements that are appropriate to the process of answering the exams and testing the level of user usability.

Autonomous vehicles are believed to reduce accidents but still demand some form of external communication signaling relevant information to pedestrians. Recent research on the design of vehicle-pedestrian communication (VPC) focuses strongly on concepts for a non-disabled population. Our work presents an inclusive user-centered design for VPC, beneficial for both vision impaired and seeing pedestrians. We conducted a workshop with VIP (N=6), discussing current issues in road traffic and comparing communication concepts proposed by literature. A thematic analysis unveiled two important themes: number of communicating vehicles and content (affecting duration). Subsequently, we investigated these in a second user study in virtual reality (N=33, 8 VIP) comparing the VPC between groups of abilities. We found that trust and understanding is enhanced and cognitive load reduced when all relevant vehicles communicate; high content messages also reduce cognitive load.},

Therefore, this paper attempts to propose a decision tree-based vocabulary difficulty judgment method in order to improve the accuracy and scientificity of English vocabulary difficulty judgment. Based on the above research contents, this paper designs and implements an English-assisted learning system which can meet the needs of different users for learning difficulty and has an exercise mechanism.

abstract = {The new coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has induced a radical change in the way people are educated. Distance or online learning has become the norm and it is important to provide new resources to ensure that continuing education takes place during this difficult time. The main objective is, therefore, to provide a service that not only supports school teaching but that can also increasingly motivate students while learning. In recent years, an increasing emphasis has been placed on geo-education in middle and high school curricula, transforming the way certain subjects are now taught to provide students with a thorough understanding of the dynamics and interconnections in the world, which are based also on relevant geographic areas information. This paper proposes the integration of advanced geospatial technology into traditional interactive learning tools as a way to describe experiences that help students understand phenomena and improve their skills, focusing on pandemic diseases, as they have happened in the history of humankind. The system is the result of a usability engineering process aimed at providing users with an effective learning experience, by iteratively analyzing their expectations and needs concerning georeferenced content. The resulting learning environment was tested in the context of a middle school program. A usability study was conducted to analyze the impact in terms of perceived quality, engagement, and learning performance of students.},

abstract = {With network slicing technology, 5G changes the classical mobile network business model from a network-operator-oriented business to a more open system with multiple stakeholders. In this context, a network slice broker plays the role of agency between network resource providers and vertical service providers, to lease and provide on-demand network slice services. In practice, a single network slice broker normally owns limited types of network slices. And a collaboration infrastructure could be built up to enable network slice sharing among multiple network slice brokers, so as to improve user experience, and enhance the resource utilization rate. However, a major challenge with such an infrastructure is how to support fair and secure slice trading process among multiple un-trusted network slice providers. Blockchain technology, on the other side, brings in high opportunities to implement a fair and secure trading system without a trusted third-party. In view of this observation, this paper proposes a design of blockchain-enabled collaboration infrastructure for network slice brokers, where a group of registered brokers can trade their network slices in a fair and secure manner. To enhance the accountability of slice trading records, transactions are verified and sorted by each broker node, which are further packed into blocks and appended to a shared ledger maintained by each member in the collaboration network. More specifically, we design a Proof-of-Majority (PoM) consensus protocol to sort slice trading transactions before packing transaction blocks of the shared ledger. Furthermore, an optimization for the basic PoM protocol is discussed, with dependency resolving strategy to improve system performance. Experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of our proposal.},

We developed various game interaction scenarios where force feedback through the thumbstick of the gamepad can be effective, and categorized them into five themes. We built a haptic device and control system that can support all presented interactions. The resulting device, FS-Pad, has sufficient fidelity to be used as a haptic game interaction design tool. To verify the presented interactions and effectiveness of the FS-Pad, we conducted a user study with game players, developers, and designers. The subjects used an FS-Pad while playing a demo game and were then interviewed. Their feedback revealed the actual needs for the presented interactions as well as insight into the potential design of game interactions when applying FS-Pad.},

Through a review of existing research on design pedagogy, an international survey of 61 HCI educators, and an analysis of popular textbooks, we ex- plore the prominent disciplinary perspectives that shape design education in the HCI classroom. We draw on our analyses to discuss the differences we see in forms of design taught, approaches to adapting design instruction in computing-based courses, and the tensions faced by instructors of these classes. We conclude by arguing for the importance of pedagogical research on design instruction as a vital and foundational area of inquiry in Interaction Design and HCI.},

However, traditional interaction methods are considered distracting and not intuitive. To overcome these issues, we performed a gesture elicitation study with a follow-up evaluation. For this, we considered TV moderators as primary users of the gestures as well as viewers as recipients. The elicited gesture set consists of five gestures for two types of camera shots (long shot and close shot). Findings of the evaluation study indicate that the derived set of gestures requires low physical and concentration effort from moderators. Also, both moderators and viewers found them appropriate to be used in TV with respect to understandability, distraction, likeability, and appropriateness. Using these gestures would allow moderators to control AR content in TV and tell stories in a modern and more expressive way.},

abstract = {Early pathogen processes of Alzheimer´s dementia (AD) develop years before the time of diagnosis. The process starts in hippocampal regions, which play an important role in spatial cognitive abilities including spatial memory. The decrease of these abilities leads to deficits in orientation and navigation and has a high impact on everyday live. A simple, fast and exact evaluation of the spatial memory impairment could help to detect the disease at an early stage (e.g. during a regular screening) and could thus enable stopping or slowing down the process. This work aims at the development of such a screening tool by combining a version of the established Smith-Milner paradigm (SMP) [26, 27] for analysis of spatial-cognitive deficits with the technical possibilities of the augmented-reality (AR) technology. A new AR-application was developed and the user acceptance was evaluated with a first group of healthy subjects (N = 40). The user interface of the AR application was specifically tailored for easy use by older participants and non-technical physicians.},

abstract = {Anti-patterns are harmful phenomena repeatedly occurring, e.g., in software development projects. Though widely recognized and well-known, their descriptions are traditionally not fit for automated detection. The detection is usually performed by manual audits, or on business process models. Both options are time-, effort- and expertise-heavy, prone to biases, and/or omissions. Meanwhile, collaborative software projects produce much data as a natural side product, capturing their status and day-to-day history. Long-term, our research aims at deriving models for the automated detection of process and project management anti-patterns, applicable to project data. Here, we present a general approach for studies investigating occurrences of these types of anti-patterns in projects and discuss the entire process of such studies in detail, starting from the anti-pattern descriptions in literature. We demonstrate and verify our approach with the Fire Drill anti-pattern detection as a case study, applying it to data from 15 student projects. The results of our study suggest that reliable detection of at least some process and project management anti-patterns in project data is possible, with 13 projects assessed accurately for Fire Drill presence by our automated detection when compared to the ground truth gathered from independent data. The overall approach can be similarly applied to detecting patterns and other phenomena with manifestations in Application Lifecycle Management data.},

abstract = {Complexity of specification models of the present day have started becoming non-trivial. Hence, there is a need to evolve existing specification languages to support writing specifications following good coding practices such as incremental development and modularisation. Statechart is a modelling notation that has wide acceptance in the industry. To the best of our knowledge all current implementations of Statecharts have one common shortcoming: all Statechart variables are global. Global variables in a specification can lead to monolithic and fragile models which are hard to maintain and reuse.In this paper, we introduce local variables in Statecharts, motivate their use through illustrative examples, formalise their semantics, and analyse their interaction with basic Statechart features like hierarchical states, transitions and history. We have implemented this Statechart variant with local variables in a specification language called StaBL. Our case studies demonstrate significant improvement in modularity in models with local variable w.r.t those without local variables.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) seek to achieve gains in productivity and time to market. Many companies in several domains are constantly adopting SPLs. Dealing with SPLs begin after companies find themselves with successful variants of a product in a particular domain. The adoption of an SPL-based approach in the automotive industry may provide a significant return on investment. To switch to an SPL-based approach, practitioners lack a reengineering approach that supports SPL migration and evolution in a systematic fashion.This paper presents a practical evolution-based approach to migrate and evolve a set of variants of a given product into an SPL and describes a case study from the automotive domain. The case study considers the need to handle the classical sensor variants family (CSVF) at Bosch Company.Using this study, we performed a contributed step toward future switch of the CSVF into the SPL. We investigated the applicability of the proposed evolution-based approach with a real variants family (using the textual requirements of the CSVF) and we evaluated our approach using several data collection methods. The results reveal that our approach can be suitable for the automotive domain in the case study.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of an educational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot prototype to support teachers in developing digital reading lists for their students. The chatbot aims to teach users how to use an educational system – Talis Aspire – effectively by giving them quick answers to questions, offering demonstrations and instructions on how to complete essential tasks on Talis Aspire, advising them how to solve problems and providing solutions for common issues. We have presented the prototype, together with the approach we used to design and develop it by considering the concepts of ‘Recontextualisation’ and ‘Quality Function Deployment’. We argue that the use of chatbot technology can not only help tutors develop online education and teaching materials but may also improve the quality of educational services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of recommendations and further work suggested by domain experts have also been highlighted in this paper in order to improve our prototype further.},

abstract = {Abstract: Since the founding of New China, people began to chase spiritual needs after gradually solving the problem of food and clothing. The state and all levels of society have paid great attention to art education, and dance art is an important part of national art and culture. With the continuous progress of science and technology, the digital era brings great opportunities for dance education while also generating great challenges. So, in the context of the Internet, promoting the popularization of dance education and promoting the combination of new technologies and popularization have become important issues that need attention at present. Through the analysis of various theories, using emerging Internet technologies such as live streaming, VR, AR, we analyze the supply side and demand side of achieving mass dance education and design a platform for promoting the realization of dance education for the masses. It can promote the masses development of dance education, improve the current situation of imbalance between supply and demand in today's art education market, and improve the cultural quality and aesthetic level of the whole society.},

abstract = {Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is the key enabler for emerging intelligent transportation systems. Applications built on top of V2X require both authentication and privacy protection for the vehicles. The common approach to meet both requirements is to use pseudonyms which are short-term identities. However, both industrial standards and state-of-the-art research are not designed for resource-constrained environments. In addition, they make a strong assumption about the security of the vehicle's on-board computation units. In this paper, we propose a lightweight auto-refreshing pseudonym protocol (LARP) for V2X. LARP supports efficient operations for resource-constrained devices, and provides security even when parts of the vehicle are compromised. We provide formal security proof showing that the protocol is secure. We conduct experiments on a Raspberry Pi 4. The results demonstrate that LARP is feasible and practical.},

abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence, e. g., for Computer Vision, through supervised learning requires the input of large amounts of annotated or labeled data objects as training data. The creation of high-quality training data is usually done manually which can be repetitive and tiring. Gamification, the use of game elements in a non-game context, is one method to make tedious tasks more interesting. This paper proposes a multi-step process for gamifying the manual creation of training data for machine learning purposes. We choose a user-adapted approach based on the results of a preceding user study with the target group (employees of an AI software development company) which helped us to identify annotation use cases and the users' player characteristics. The resulting concept includes levels of increasing difficulty, tutorials, progress indicators and a narrative built around a robot character which at the same time is a user assistant. The implemented prototype is an extension of the company's existing annotation tool and serves as a basis for further observations.},

abstract = {A major challenge in teaching use-case modeling (UCM) is to mitigate the difficulties of students that prevent them from producing use-case models with quality. The strategies for UCM are scattered in the literature in several areas, and may not be known to the students, who therefore fail to receive the benefits that would mitigate their difficulties. This paper aims to present a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify, gather and analyze strategies for UCM. During the SLR, two thousand two hundred sixty-six studies published between 2008 and 2018 were returned from 6 bases (ACM, IEEE, Scopus, Science Direct, SpringerLink and Engineering Village), which resulted in the selection of 39 primary studies. These were classified, following the coding procedures of Grounded Theory, into 13 categories of different strategies for UCM. The results can help teachers in the adoption of the most appropriate UCM strategies for their students. Besides, they provide a quick reference for teachers and researchers interested in conducting additional studies on teaching strategies for UCM.},
