The verification procedure-implemented in the Cornell Hybrid Technology tool, HyTech-applies to hybrid automata whose continuous dynamics is governed by linear constraints on the variables and their derivatives.

One such process is inspection, in which several reviewers independently analyze all or part of the specification and search for faults. These faults are then collected at a meeting of the reviewers and author(s). Usually, reviewers use Ad Hoc or Checklist methods to uncover faults. These methods force all reviewers to rely on nonsystematic techniques to search for a wide variety of faults. We hypothesize that a Scenario-based method, in which each reviewer uses different, systematic techniques to search for different, specific classes of faults, will have a significantly higher success rate. We evaluated this hypothesis using a 3/spl times/2/sup 4/ partial factorial, randomized experimental design. Forty eight graduate students in computer science participated in the experiment. They were assembled into sixteen, three-person teams. Each team inspected two SRS using some combination of Ad Hoc, Checklist or Scenario methods. For each inspection we performed four measurements: (1) individual fault detection rate, (2) team fault detection rate, (3) percentage of faults first identified at the collection meeting (meeting gain rate), and (4) percentage of faults first identified by an individual, but never reported at the collection meeting (meeting loss rate). The experimental results are that (1) the Scenario method had a higher fault detection rate than either Ad Hoc or Checklist methods, (2) Scenario reviewers were more effective at detecting the faults their scenarios are designed to uncover, and were no less effective at detecting other faults than both Ad Hoc or Checklist reviewers, (3) Checklist reviewers were no more effective than Ad Hoc reviewers, and (4) Collection meetings produced no net improvement in the fault detection rate-meeting gains were offset by meeting losses.<>","1939-3520","","10.1109/32.391380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=391380","","Inspection;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Design for experiments;Computer science;Assembly;Performance evaluation;Gain measurement;Loss measurement;Performance gain","formal specification;formal verification;software development management","detection methods;software requirements inspections;replicated experiment;software requirements specifications;nonsystematic techniques;scenario-based method;individual fault detection rate;team fault detection rate;fault detection rate","","249","1","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers. Three widely used data sets are used to evaluate the UbeHealth system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846609","King Abdulaziz University(grant numbers:G-661-611-38); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8382164","Cloudlets;deep learning;Internet of Things (IoT);mobile edge computing;mobile healthcare;preventive healthcare;traffic classification;traffic prediction;survey;fog computing;cloud computing;multimedia applications;smart cities","Medical services;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Quality of service;Machine learning;Smart cities;Internet of Things","Big Data;cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;mobile computing;parallel processing;protocols;quality of service;smart cities","smart cities;mobile cloud computing;future healthcare demands;network latency;next-generation healthcare;ubiquitous healthcare framework;edge computing;deep learning;high-performance computing;HPC;network traffic;network layers;data rates;data caching;application protocols;anomalous data;Big Data;UbeHealth system;personalized ubiquitous cloud computing;edge-enabled networked healthcare system;personalized healthcare;patient data analysis;reliability;Internet of Things;IoT;enhanced network quality of service;routing decisions;traffic flows;malicious traffic detection","","159","","145","OAPA","12 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Construct validity was used to compare the performance difference between two groups of participants (faculty members and dental graduate students). These participants were required to perform three periodontal examination and treatment procedures including periodontal pocket probing, calculus detection, and removal. From the evaluation results, we found that penetration between tool and teeth or cheek will greatly decrease the fidelity of the simulation, therefore, it is necessary to utilize 6-DOF haptic device with both force and torque feedback in dental simulator, and accordingly it is needed to extend point-based rendering to 6-DOF haptic rendering of multiregion contacts.

Before we can modularize the crosscutting concerns in our programs to increase software quality, we must first be able to find them. Unfortunately, accurately locating the code related to a concern is difficult, and without proper metrics, determining how much the concern is crosscutting is impossible. We propose a systematic methodology for identifying which code is related to which concern, and a suite of metrics for quantifying the amount of crosscutting code. Our concern identification and assignment guidelines resolve some of the ambiguity issues encountered by other researchers. We applied this approach to systematically identify all the requirement concerns in a 13,531 line program.

In this approach, the surgeon inserts specially-designed instruments through a small incision on the patient's skin into the body cavities, abdomen, veins or, arteries and performs the surgery on organs. As a major limitation, surgeons lose their natural tactile perception due to indirect touch on the organs. Since the loss of tactile perception compromises the ability of surgeons in tissue distinction and maneuvers, researchers have proposed different tactile sensors. This review is to provide researchers with a literature map for the state-of-the-art of tactile sensors in minimally invasive surgery, e.g. in robotic, laparoscopic, palpation, biopsy, heart ablation, and valvuloplasty. In this regard, the pertinent literature from the year 2000 on sensing principles, design requirements, and specifications were reviewed in this study. The survey showed that size, range, resolution, variation, electrical passivity, and magnetic-resonance-compatibility were the most critical specification to study for tactile sensors. Based on the results, some of the requirements, e.g., magnetic-resonance-compatibility and electrical passivity are of less generality and more application-dependent; however, size, resolution, and range specifications differ for various applications and are of utmost importance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2962636","Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies; Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies; Concordia University; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Concordia University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8943415","Electrical sensors;minimally invasive surgery;optical sensors;robotic surgery;tactile sensors","Tactile sensors;Force;Optical sensors;Minimally invasive surgery","biomedical measurement;blood vessels;medical robotics;skin;surgery;tactile sensors;touch (physiological)","tissue distinction;tactile sensors;heart ablation;electrical passivity;magnetic-resonance-compatibility;minimally invasive surgery;arteries;organs;natural tactile perception;skin;body cavities;abdomen;veins;biopsy;valvuloplasty;palpation;robotic surgery;laparoscopic surgery","","48","","121","CCBY","26 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For a deeper understanding of the complex interdependencies between genes, it is important to bring gene expressions (measurements) into context with pathways. Pathways, which are models of biological processes, are available in online databases. In these databases, large networks are decomposed into small sub-graphs for better manageability. This simplification results in a loss of context, as pathways are interconnected and genes can occur in multiple instances scattered over the network. Our main goal is therefore to present all relevant information, i.e., gene expressions, the relations between expression and pathways and between multiple pathways in a simple, yet effective way. To achieve this we employ two different multiple-view approaches. Traditional multiple views are used for large datasets or highly interactive visualizations, while a 2.5D technique is employed to support a seamless navigation of multiple pathways which simultaneously links to the expression of the contained genes. This approach facilitates the understanding of the interconnection of pathways, and enables a non-distracting relation to gene expression data. We evaluated Caleydo with a group of users from the life science community. Users were asked to perform three tasks: pathway exploration, gene expression analysis and information comparison with and without visual links, which had to be conducted in four different conditions. Evaluation results show that the system can improve the process of understanding the complex network of pathways and the individual effects of gene expression regulation considerably. Especially the quality of the available contextual information and the spatial organization was rated good for the presented 2.5D setup.","2165-8773","978-1-4244-6686-3","10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2010.5429609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5429609","Bioinformatics;Visual Analysis;Pathways;Gene Expression;Multiple Views;Linking & Brushing","Gene expression;Databases;Diseases;Biological system modeling;Biological processes;Scattering;Data visualization;Navigation;Information analysis;Performance analysis","bioinformatics;data visualisation;database management systems;solid modelling","visual analysis framework;Caleydo framework;gene expression data;biological context;hypotheses generation process;pathways models;online databases;multiple-view approaches;2.5D technique","","42","3","24","IEEE","11 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Trajectories in sports, such as the movement of players and balls, contain rich information on player behavior and thus have been widely analyzed by coaches and analysts to improve the players' performance. However, existing visual analytics systems often present the trajectories in court diagrams that are abstractions of reality, thereby causing difficulty for the experts to imagine the situation on the court and understand why the player acted in a certain way. With recent developments in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), experts gradually have the opportunity to see, feel, explore, and understand these 3D trajectories from the player's perspective. Yet, few research has studied how to support immersive analysis of sports data from such a perspective. Specific challenges are rooted in data presentation (e.g., how to seamlessly combine 2D and 3D visualizations) and interaction (e.g., how to naturally interact with data without keyboard and mouse) in VR. To address these challenges, we have worked closely with domain experts who have worked for a top national badminton team to design ShuttleSpace. Our system leverages 1) the peripheral vision to combine the 2D and 3D visualizations and 2) the VR controller to support natural interactions via a stroke metaphor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ShuttleSpace through three case studies conducted by the experts with useful insights. We further conduct interviews with the experts whose feedback confirms that our first-person immersive analytics system is suitable and useful for analyzing badminton data.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030392","National Key RD Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB 1004300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61761136020,61890954); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LR18F020001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222313","Movement trajectory;badminton analytics;virtual reality","Trajectory;Three-dimensional displays;Sports;Data visualization;Two dimensional displays;Visualization;Games","data analysis;data visualisation;interactive systems;sport;virtual reality","stroke metaphor;peripheral vision;2D visualization;3D visualization;3D trajectories;movement trajectory analysis;badminton data analysis;first-person immersive analytics system;natural interactions;national badminton team;domain experts;data presentation;sports data;immersive analysis;VR controller;virtual reality;immersive technologies;court diagrams;visual analytics systems;coaches;player behavior;trajectory data;ShuttleSpace;immersive visualization","","33","","49","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Especially in terms of content caching, the cognitive engine can perceive the content requirements of users and match the content providers and content requesters to improve the caching hit rate. However, during this process, users may worry that their privacy data may be leaked. Content requesters need to submit data about points of interest in contents, which is part of their sensitive information. In addition, in terms of rapid speed of vehicles, the connection time is limited, such as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside unit (RSU), which leads to limited transaction time during obtaining contents. In order to solve these problems, in this article, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-aware content caching architecture in CIoV. In general, when vehicles need contents, in order to protect the privacy of vehicles, it is no longer necessary to submit a request to an RSU, but through broadcasting contents from an RSU or surrounding vehicles, where vehicles can selectively obtain contents. To improve the cache hit rate, the cognitive engine will perceive content requirements and recommend relevant content requirements to an RSU or content-providing vehicles based on machine learning or deep learning methods. However, this method of content acquisition will connect different vehicles, which brings the untrusted problem. Both content requesters and providers may worry about untrusted users connected with them. To this end, we adopt the blockchain technology to record the completed content transactions, which are written into the block after the consensus mechanism is completed, thus solving the problem of distrust between vehicles. Experiments demonstrate the privacy-aware content caching architecture based on blockchains effectiveness.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.001.1900161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9055736","","Engines;Privacy;Blockchain;Artificial intelligence;Internet;Data privacy;Vehicular ad hoc networks","cache storage;content management;cryptography;data privacy;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation","blockchain technology;Cognitive Internet of Vehicles;completed content transactions;content acquisition;content-providing vehicles;relevant content requirements;cache hit rate;blockchain-based privacy-aware content caching architecture;RSU;vehicle-to-roadside unit;vehicle-to-vehicle;privacy data;caching hit rate;content requesters;content providers;resource allocation;vehicle deployment;cognitive engine","","31","","15","IEEE","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Based on these diagrams, the noncascading PFC switching regulators can be classified into three categories, each offering a different set of performances. The first category permits a tradeoff between the efficiency and the input-current harmonic distortion, the second permits a tradeoff between the efficiency and the size of the storage element for the load voltage regulation, and the third allows a tradeoff among all the performances. With detailed analyses through analytical approaches, simulation results illustrate the performances of these three categories of noncascading PFC switching regulators.

Given an input program that satisfies the functional requirements, the proposed programming environment will automatically generate a set of candidate program implementations, all of which share functionality, but each of which differ in their non-functional trade offs. The software designer navigates this diverse Pareto surface of candidate implementations, gaining insight into the trade offs and selecting solutions for different platforms and environments, thereby stretching beyond the reach of current compiler technologies. Rather than having to focus on the details required to manage complex, inter-related and conflicting, non-functional trade offs, the designer is thus freed to explore, to understand, to control and to decide rather than to construct.","","978-1-4503-1204-2","10.1145/2351676.2351678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494900","Compilation;Genetic Programming;Non-functional Properties;Pareto Surface;SBSE;Search Based Optimization","","genetic algorithms;Pareto optimisation;software engineering","GISMOE challenge;Pareto program surface;genetic programming;program optimization;speed property;size property;throughput property;power consumption property;bandwidth property;software development environment;search based software engineering;SBSE;genetic improvement of software for multiple objective exploration","","25","","98","","8 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to overcome these problems, we introduce an infrastructure for supporting the development of specific AR interaction techniques and their adaptation to individual user needs. Our approach is threefold: a flexible AR framework providing independence from particular input devices and rendering platforms, an interaction prototyping mechanism allowing for fast prototyping of new interaction techniques, and a high-level user interface description, extending user interface descriptions into the domain of AR. The general usability and applicability of the approach is demonstrated by means of three example AR projects.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.90","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512022","Index Terms- Distributed systems;distributed applications;multimedia information systems;artificial;augmented;and virtual realities;user interfaces;collaborative computing;graphics systems;distributed/network graphics;methodology and techniques;device independence;graphics data structures and data types;interaction techniques;three-dimensional graphics and realism;virtual reality.","Augmented reality;User interfaces;Virtual reality;Application software;Graphics;Prototypes;Computer interfaces;Wearable computers;Computer displays;Iris","augmented reality;data structures;groupware;human computer interaction;multimedia computing;rendering (computer graphics);user interfaces","custom-tailored augmented reality;user interface;rendering platform;interaction prototyping mechanism;distributed system;distributed application;multimedia information systems;artificial reality;augmented reality;virtual reality;collaborative computing;graphics system;distributed-network graphics;device independence;graphics data structure;data type;3D graphics","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Cybernetics;Data Display;Environment;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Man-Machine Systems;Models, Theoretical;Online Systems;User-Computer Interface","22","17","44","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This quantification is necessary to know about the security state of an SDLC artifact after each phase of software development. Moreover, this could help the software developers in allocating further resources to increase security and decrease the vulnerabilities in any software.

The tactic in badminton is defined as a sequence of consecutive strokes. Most existing methods use statistical models to find sequential patterns of strokes and apply 2D visualizations such as glyphs and statistical charts to explore and analyze the discovered patterns. However, in badminton, spatial information like the shuttle trajectory, which is inherently 3D, is the core of a tactic. The lack of sufficient spatial awareness in 2D visualizations largely limited the tactic analysis of badminton. In this work, we collaborate with domain experts to study the tactic analysis of badminton in a 3D environment and propose an immersive visual analytics system, TIVEE, to assist users in exploring and explaining badminton tactics from multi-levels. Users can first explore various tactics from the third-person perspective using an unfolded visual presentation of stroke sequences. By selecting a tactic of interest, users can turn to the first-person perspective to perceive the detailed kinematic characteristics and explain its effects on the game result. The effectiveness and usefulness of TIVEE are demonstrated by case studies and an expert interview.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114861","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1004300); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:LR18F020001); Collaborative Innovation Center of Artificial Intelligence by MOE and Zhejiang Provincial Government (ZJU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9557225","Tactic analysis;stroke sequence visualization;immersive visualization","Trajectory;Sports;Three-dimensional displays;Data visualization;Visualization;Games;Layout","biomechanics;data analysis;data mining;data visualisation;pattern recognition;sport;statistical analysis","immersive visualizations;tactic analysis;immersive visual analytics system;TIVEE;unfolded visual presentation;badminton tactics;visual exploration;visual explanation;consecutive strokes;statistical models;stroke sequential patterns;2D visualizations;glyphs;statistical charts;pattern discovery;spatial information;shuttle trajectory;spatial awareness;3D environment;third-person perspective;stroke sequence;kinematic characteristics","Biomechanical Phenomena;Computer Graphics;Humans;Racquet Sports","19","","62","IEEE","1 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, PCD can leak sensitive information about consumers' activities. Various privacy-preserving data collection schemes have been proposed for AMI networks to allow the collection of an aggregated PCD to preserve consumers' privacy. However, most of these schemes are designed for single-recipient AMI networks and cannot be used efficiently for multi-recipient AMI networks in which several entities should have access to the aggregated PCD of different sets of users for legitimate uses. In this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving data collection and access control scheme for multi-recipient AMI networks named EPDA. We developed a novel proxy re-encryption scheme that allows data aggregation before re-encryption and can allow either full or partial access to the aggregated data after re-encryption as needed. The proposed scheme can be used for fine-grained access control for multi-recipient AMI networks in which each recipient can access only the data intended to it. The EPDA uses lightweight operations in encryption, aggregation, and decryption which result in low computation and communication overheads. Our security analysis demonstrates that the EPDA is secure, can resist collusion attacks and hide customers' distribution which is needed for a fair electricity trade market. Our experimental results confirm that the EPDA has improved performance for the computational cost at each entity in the AMI network and low communication overhead.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900934","Qatar Foundation(grant numbers:NPRP10-1223-160045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648329","Smart grid;AMI networks;privacy preservation;data aggregation;proxy re-encryption;fine-grained access control","Access control;Privacy;Data aggregation;Encryption;Data privacy","authorisation;cryptography;power consumption","real-time monitoring;energy management;proxy re-encryption scheme;lightweight operations;communication overheads;fair electricity trade market;fine-grained access control;data aggregation;EPDA;access control scheme;efficient privacy-preserving data collection;single-recipient AMI networks;aggregated PCD;privacy-preserving data collection schemes;fine-grained power consumption data;advanced metering infrastructure networks;multirecipient AMI networks","","19","","59","CCBY","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is essential to ensure the usability and user acceptance of XR systems for the wider adoption in manufacturing. The proposed framework was developed through six case studies that covered different XR system developments for different application areas of manufacturing. The framework consists of five iterative phases: (1) requirements analysis, (2) solution selection, (3) data preparation, (4) system implementation and (5) system evaluation. It is validated through one empirical case and seven identified previous studies, which partly aligned with the proposed framework.

Its study is important for the design of virtual reality simulators, and for the specification of augmented reality applications that overcome current limitations and provide a supersensing to the surgeon. As part of this work, this article addresses the study of laparoscopic pulling forces. Two definitions are proposed to focalize the problem: the perceptual fidelity boundary, limit of human perceptual capabilities, and the Utile fidelity boundary, that encapsulates the perceived aspects actually used by surgeons to guide an operation. The study is then aimed to define the perceptual fidelity boundary of laparoscopic pulling forces. This is approached with an experimental design in which surgeons assess the resistance against pulling of four different tissues, which are characterized with both in vivo interaction forces and ex vivo tissue biomechanical properties. A logarithmic law of tissue consistency perception is found comparing subjective valorizations with objective parameters. A model of this perception is developed identifying what the main parameters are: the grade of fixation of the organ, the tissue stiffness, the amount of tissue bitten, and the organ mass being pulled. These results are a clear requirement analysis for the force feedback algorithm of a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator. Finally, some discussion is raised about the suitability of augmented reality applications around this surgical gesture.

However, CAD software does not allow intuitive analysis and manipulation of 3D models for users without a CAD or computer science background. Using Virtual Reality (VR) technologies to enhance engineering design reviews has been an area of interest for researchers since the advent of modern VR.

Robotic devices can help to investigate the psychological fundamentals of body schema integration. While the Rubber Hand Illusion experiment indicates how artifacts can be perceived as a part of the own body, it relies on a passive limb that does not perform motions during the examinations. Novel setups aim at Robotic Hand/Leg Illusions induced by robotic devices which imitate human motions. Although such devices distinctly extend experimental possibilities, their design is rather proprietary and unstructured up to now. This paper analyzes the requirements of robotic hand and leg illusion setups based on systematic discussion of a multidisciplinary team of researchers from engineering and psychology. In a comparative study, requirements are collected and structured, their similarities and differences are determined, and the most important ones are extracted yielding design implications. The requirements with the highest priority are setup characteristics that concern the occurrence and quality of the illusion, i.e., hiding the real limb, anatomical plausibility, visual appearance, temporal delay, and software-controlled experimental conditions. Based on the results, the design of future robotic devices for the exploration of human body schema integration might be guided and supported.","1944-9437","978-1-5090-3929-6","10.1109/ROMAN.2016.7745205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7745205","","Legged locomotion;Delays;Robot sensing systems;Psychology;Rubber;Visualization","biomechanics;human-robot interaction;manipulators;motion control","software-controlled experimental conditions;temporal delay;visual appearance;anatomical plausibility;human motion imitation;passive limb;rubber hand illusion experiment;body schema integration;psychological fundamentals;robotic device;human-robot interaction;human users;user-proximal robot;leg illusion;robotic hand illusion;design requirement analysis;human body schema exploration","","15","","42","IEEE","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a new method for efficiently converting PSL formulas into symbolically represented Nondeterministic (Generalized) BÜchi Automata (NGBA) that are typically used in many verification and analysis tools. The construction is based on a normal form that separates the LTL and the SERE components, and allows for a modular and specialized encoding. The compilation is enhanced by a set of syntactic transformations that aim at reducing the state space of the resulting NGBA. These rules enable to achieve, at low cost, the simplification that can be achieved with expensive semantic techniques based on minimization. A thorough experimental analysis over large sets of paradigmatic properties (from patterns of properties commonly used in practice) shows that our approach drastically reduces the compilation time and positively affects the overall search time.

In future VR learning environments, students would have challenges in taking notes when they wear a head mounted display (HMD). To solve this problem, we installed a digital tablet on the desk and provided several tools in VR to facilitate the learning experience. Specifically, we track the stylus' position and orientation in the physical world and then render a virtual stylus in VR. In other words, when students see a virtual stylus somewhere on the desk, they can reach out with their hand for the physical stylus. The information provided will also enable them to know where they will draw or write before the stylus touches the tablet. Since the presented iVRNote featuring our note taking system is a digital environment, we also enable students save efforts in taking extensive notes by providing several functions, such as post-editing and picture taking, so that they can pay more attention to lectures in VR. We also record the time of each stroke on the note to help students review a lecture. They can select a part of their note to revisit the corresponding segment in a virtual online lecture. Figures and the accompanying video demonstrate the feasibility of the presented iVRNote system. To evaluate the system, we conducted a user study with 20 participants to assess the preference and pedagogical benefits of the iVRNote interface. The feedback provided by the participants were overall positive and indicated that the iVRNote interface could be potentially effective in VR learning experiences.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-1377-7","10.1109/VR.2019.8798338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798338","Virtual reality;classroom;on-line learning;Human-centered computing—Visualization—Visualization techniques—Education;Human-centered computing—Visualization—Visualization design and evaluation methods","Three-dimensional displays;Writing;Tools;Tracking;Education;Portable computers;Task analysis","computer aided instruction;helmet mounted displays;human computer interaction;interactive video;virtual reality","virtual online lecture;pedagogical benefits;iVRNote interface;VR learning experiences;interactive note-taking interface;learning reflection lectures;digital tablet;learning experience;physical world;virtual stylus;digital environment;iVRNote system;VR learning environments;head mounted display;HMD;physical stylus render","","15","","48","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We quantify the maximum achievable rate for the D2D network, subject to a probabilistic interference power constraint based on imperfect channel state information. First, we perform a convexity analysis that reveals that the finite block-length rate for the D2D pair in short-packet transmission is not always concave. To address this issue, we propose two effective resource allocation schemes using the successive convex approximation based iterative algorithm. To gain more insights, we exploit the monotonicity of the average finite block-length rate. By capitalizing on this property, an optimal power control policy is proposed, followed by closed-form expressions and approximations for the optimal average power and the maximum achievable average rate in the finite block-length regime.

The framework is designed for both mobile and desktop avatar-based human-machine or human-human visual communications in real-world scenarios. Using 3-D components stored in the Java mobile 3-D (M3G) file format, the avatar models can be flexibly constructed and customized on the fly on any mobile devices or systems that support the M3G standard. For the RAC head tracker, we propose a 2-D real-time face detection/tracking strategy through an interactive loop, in which the detection and tracking complement each other for efficient and reliable face localization, tolerating extreme user movement. With the face location robustly tracked, the RAC head tracker selects a main user and estimates the user's head rolling, tilting, yawing, scaling, horizontal, and vertical motion in order to generate avatar animation parameters. The animation parameters can be used either locally or remotely and can be transmitted through socket over the network. In addition, it integrates audio-visual analysis and synthesis modules to realize multichannel and runtime animations, visual TTS and real-time viseme detection and rendering. The framework is recognized as an effective design for future realistic industrial products of humanoid kiosk and human-to-human mobile communication.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2008.918441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4449082","Avatar;DAZ3D;head tracking;human–computer interaction;mobile 3-D (M3G);multimodal system;real-time multi modal human–avatar interaction (RTM-HAI);TTS;visual communication;RTM-HAI;avatar;M3G;DAZ3D,;TTS;head tracking;multimodal system;human computer interaction;visual communication","Face detection;Tracking loops;Facial animation;Avatars;Communication system control;Man machine systems;Visual communication;Java;Robustness;Motion estimation","avatars;face recognition;user interfaces","real-time multimodal human-avatar interaction;remote animation control;human-human visual communications;Java mobile 3-D file format;mobile devices;face location;audio-visual analysis;humanoid kiosk;human-to-human mobile communication","","14","3","32","IEEE","15 Apr 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of Internet technologies has the potential to increase the availability of evidence-based mental health services for a far-reaching population with the use of fewer resources. Despite evidence that Internet Interventions can be effective means in mental health morbidities, most current IDPT systems are tunnel-based, inflexible, and non-interoperable. Hence it becomes essential to understand which elements of an Internet intervention contribute to effectiveness and treatment outcomes. By analogy, adaptation is a central aspect of successful face-to-face mental health therapy. Adaptability to patient needs can be regarded as an essential outcome factor in online systems for mental health interventions as well. While some aspects of rule-based and machine-learning-based adaptation have attracted attention in recent IDPT development, systematic reporting of core components, dimensions of adaptiveness, information architecture, and strategies for adaptation in the IDPT system are still lacking. To bridge this gap, we propose a model that shows how adaptive systems are represented in classical control theory and discuss how the model can be used to specify adaptive IDPT systems. Concerning the reference model, we outline the core components of adaptive IDPT systems, the main adaptive elements, dimensions of adaptiveness, information architecture applied to adaptive systems, and strategies used in the adaptation process.

This makes any modification to the application dependent on programming, making CVEs construction and extension in large scale a challenging task. The ability to change an application without having to stop it is an important nonfunctional requirement for CVEs, especially if they are to be provided as Web services, available around the clock. This paper presents a novel solution for building and extending CVEs through the integration of interactive non-linear stories and virtual reality concepts. With this approach, CVEs applications can be composed as non-linear stories, which can be changed either completely or partly, making it easier for developers to build and/or extend CVEs applications. The innovative concept of this solution can make the development process of CVEs easier and faster, allowing their production in large scale. An art installation scenario is presented in this paper as a case study to illustrate how atomic simulations and VEML language can describe CVEs and extend them at runtime.","1550-6525","0-7695-2462-1","10.1109/DISTRA.2005.5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1530657","","Collaboration;Virtual environment;Large-scale systems;World Wide Web;Web services;Clocks;Buildings;Virtual reality;Production;Art","groupware;virtual reality;Internet;digital simulation","collaborative virtual environment simulations;World Wide Web;CVE supporting systems;Web services;virtual reality;atomic simulations;VEML language","","12","","17","IEEE","14 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most studies focus on the rehabilitation of the fingers but ignore the recovery of wrist motor function. In this paper, three virtual guiding tasks were designed to assess wrist motor functions, including the basic motor flexibility, motion stability, and a range of active motion. A haptic device was used to provide haptic feedback to users who performed virtual tasks in a virtual reality (VR) environment. In total, 46 healthy subjects and 10 UMNL patients were included to test the effectiveness of the designed tasks on improving wrist motor assessments. Quantitative performances, including the completion time, contact force, and motion trajectory, were automatically acquired during the tasks. Measurements for 95% of control subjects were used to establish normative references. Patient deficiencies in the wrist motor function were identified when their quantitative performances were outside the normative control ranges. The results suggest that the designed virtual tasks are sensitive for patients in the later period of rehabilitation, making the assessment suitable for using at home.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2909287","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:L172016); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11421202,61761166002); Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:161100001016013); National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2016YFC1102203,2016YFC1101100); State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems(grant numbers:VRLAB2018T01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8682090","Upper motor neuron lesion;fine motor skills;wrist motor function;haptic feedback;virtual reality","Task analysis;Haptic interfaces;Wrist;Tools;Force;Performance evaluation;Training","diseases;haptic interfaces;medical computing;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","virtual guiding tasks;wrist motor function;haptic feedback;wrist motor assessments;upper motor neuron lesions;impaired motor function;motor flexibility;virtual reality;patient rehabilitation","Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Feedback, Sensory;Female;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Motor Neuron Disease;Psychomotor Performance;Range of Motion, Articular;Software;Stroke;Stroke Rehabilitation;Virtual Reality;Wrist;Young Adult","11","","43","IEEE","9 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to help customers to select the appropriate product family so that the closest variant can be quickly generated and delivered, this paper proposes a virtual design approach by developing virtual prototypes to represent the product platform. With virtual prototypes, assessments of constant delivery can be made to facilitate the selection and negotiation process between sales and customers, thus enabling better informed customization design. The primary goal of virtual design for mass customization is to provide a multidisciplinary design definition at the product family level, and the closest product variant can be rapidly generated. Furthermore, a scenario based simulation environment for design trade-off can be done in an integrated framework. Such a design environment facilitates capturing customer needs and appropriately informing them of the capability of the firm. Ultimately, through virtual design, customers can directly interact with the CAD systems to make trade-offs among factors that are important to them. These factors can be performance, aesthetics, value, cost, urgency, and others. This paper discusses the technical issues that need to be addressed in realizing virtual design and an example is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.","","0-7803-4192-9","10.1109/ETFA.1997.616234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=616234","","Product design;Product customization;Mass customization;Mass production;Virtual manufacturing;Economies of scale;Virtual prototyping;Design automation;Costs;Product development","concurrent engineering","virtual design;product customization;mass customization;product selection;sales negotiation;multidisciplinary design definition;design trade-off;CAD systems","","11","2","31","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Notwithstanding the ever increasing potential of innovative software and network technologies, collaborative working environments still require advanced solutions to effectively managing their inherent complexity, thereby boosting productivity and creativity. Essential components of innovative service-based collaborative working environments are collaboration-aware services that embed the required point-to-point or multi-point interaction patterns to support the flexible orchestration of distributed and concurrent activities. This paper introduces an approach that attempts to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks of current collaborative working environments by exploiting the precepts recently introduced by model-driven development and MDA (model driven architecture). The proposed approach is guided by a model transformation framework that makes use of the set of MDA-related standards (MOF, QVT and XMI) to obtain a high degree of automation, so that interoperable model transformation services can be implemented in a timely and efficient way. At the end, the single tool usually operated by a given worker can be considered as a virtual collaborative platform for creating and automatically transforming models of different types and at various levels of abstraction.","","978-1-4244-1318-8","10.1109/COLCOM.2007.4553876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4553876","service-based collaborative environments;model transformation;MDA;productivity;creativity","Productivity;Collaborative work;Collaborative software;Humans;Environmental management;Innovation management;Technology management;Boosting;Automation;Collaborative tools","groupware;software architecture","model transformation framework;software-network technologies;service-based collaborative working environments;multipoint interaction patterns;model driven architecture;virtual collaborative platform","","10","","21","IEEE","27 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to converged network and standardization of more simplified protocols, now there are many deployments that are based on ubiquitous computing framework. However, there is not very much evidence to tackle complex events that are raised by very many devices in the framework in a uniform manner. The events that are raised by devices are not the same due to heterogeneous software and network system. Also, events that are generated could be 'reactive' or 'proactive'; the, former is caused due to an action that causes an event to be triggered, for example software process failure, external change in the system state or just an informative message, latter ones need some sort of action required by the system to handle the futuristic reaction. The main challenge is to effectively handle both reactive and proactive events that are probabilistic in nature by looking into event context, timing and casualties. Also, the systems that are in use today in ubicomp framework mainly are custom made to meet specific domain. In this paper, a complex event processing framework for ubicomp by making use of industry standard protocols would be created. In order to demonstrate that such system is capable and required in ubiquitous computing framework in next generation network, a prototype middleware would be designed and developed which will be capable of handling various events and processes them proactively. This prototype model would be called a sPEPUS (Proactive Event Processing Using SIP).","","978-1-4244-3688-0","10.1109/ICNS.2009.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976814","","Ubiquitous computing;Pervasive computing;Physics computing;Communication system security;Next generation networking;Middleware;Protocols;Timing;Prototypes;Expert systems","middleware;protocols;ubiquitous computing","ubiquitous computing;next generation network;protocol;ubicomp framework;complex event processing framework;middleware","","9","","35","IEEE","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The concept of Digital Pipeline comes from Digital Earth, and can be considered a specific application of Digital Earth. We introduce our design and implementation of a Digital Pipeline in this paper. Our implementation focuses on pipeline GIS (Geographic Information System) and VR (Virtual Reality) applications. We mainly introduce pipeline GIS in this paper. The pipeline GIS provides an information framework for Digital Pipeline, it concentrates on two-dimensional (2D) spatial and property data acquiring, storing, processing, analyzing, and sharing in the GIS framework. We divide the pipeline GIS into three modules according to their roles and functionalities: the data management module, the WebGIS module and the data service module. Every module provides corresponding functionality according to user's different data requirement. The data management module is a desktop application that adopts the C/S model. Its objective is to manage pipeline data stored in the GIS server. It also provides professional functionality for pipeline data analyzing, routine administering and maintaining. The WebGIS module is a web-based GIS application that adopts the B/S model. Its purpose is to promote pipeline information sharing by publishing pipeline data to the internet and providing browser-based pipeline data displaying, inquiring, and analyzing. The data service module stores the pipeline database. It provides the data service for the data management module and the WebGIS module. The core of the data service module is the pipeline database, which is an ESRI Geodatabase implementing in terms of a pipeline data model that extending and refining from ArcGIS Pipeline Data Model (APDM). In this paper, we elaborate the pipeline GIS design and implementation process, including the related technologies and their application in the system.

Whether it be product development, design optimisation, performance improvement, or predictive maintenance, digital twins are changing the ways work is undertaken in various industries with multifarious business applications. Aerospace industry, including its manufacturing base, is one such keen adopter of digital twins with an unprecedented interest in their bespoke design, development, and implementation across wider operations and critical functions. This, however, comes with some misconceptions about the digital twin technology and lack of understanding with respect to its optimal implementation. For instance, equating a digital twin to an intelligent model while ignoring the essential components of data acquisition and visualisation, misleads the creators into building digital shadow or digital models, instead of the actual digital twin. This paper unfolds such intricacies of digital twin technology for the aerospace community in particular and others in general so as to remove the fallacies that affect their effective realisation for safety-critical systems. It comprises a comprehensive survey of digital twins and their constituent elements. Elaborating their characteristic state-of-the-art composition along with corresponding limitations, three dimensions of the future digital twins for the aerospace sector, termed as aero-Digital Twins (aero-DTs), are proposed as an outcome of this survey. These include the interactive, standardisation, and cognitive dimensions of digital twins, which if leveraged diligently could help the aero-DT research and development community quadruple the efficiency of existing and future aerospace systems as well as their associated processes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3136458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9656111","Digital twins;aircraft operation and maintenance;aerospace manufacturing","Digital twin;Computational modeling;Aerospace industry;Atmospheric modeling;Aircraft;Sensors;Analytical models","aerospace computing;aerospace industry;business data processing;data acquisition;data visualisation;product development;safety-critical software","digital twin technology;aero-digital twins;aerospace industry;product development;design optimisation;predictive maintenance;business applications;data acquisition;data visualisation;safety-critical systems;aero-DTs","","8","","157","CCBY","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finally, we discuss the relative dominance of visual and haptic cues during a targeting task. The results indicate that while the spatial discrepancies studied exerted a small effect on the time required to perform targeting, they impacted the absolute errors considerably. Additionally, we report that haptic wall stiffness has a significant effect on absolute errors while the visual cursor diameter has a significant effect on movement time. Finally, we conclude that while both visual and haptic cues are important during targeting tasks, haptic cues played a more dominant role than visual cues.

The decisions taken during this formulation are crucial for satisfying requirements. In environments which are characterized by uncertainty and dynamism, deviation from these assumptions is the norm and may trigger ""surprises"". Our method allows designers to make explicit links between the possible emergence of surprises, risks and design trade-offs. The method can be used to explore the design decisions for self-adaptive systems and choose among decisions that better fulfil (or rather partially fulfil) non-functional requirements and address their trade-offs. The analysis can also provide designers with valuable input for refining the adaptation decisions to balance, for example, resilience (i.e. Satisfiability of non-functional requirements and their trade-offs) and stability (i.e. Minimizing the frequency of adaptation). The objective is to provide designers of self adaptive systems with a basis for multi-dimensional what-if analysis to revise and improve the understanding of the environment and its effect on non-functional requirements and thereafter decision-making. We have applied the method to a wireless sensor network for flood prediction.

The research in this paper is a funded project within the general dynamics led data and information fusion defense technology centre consortium in the UK. The research is concerned with the development of a novel approach to smart decision support systems that incorporates critical success factors (CSFs) with soft computing techniques to support commanders' intuitive decision making in high velocity, high pressure military decision making environments. The smart decision support system (SDSS) seeks to overcome the danger of information overload and reduce the burden of communications by parsimoniously gathering, fusing and presenting key information to satisfy commanders' critical information requirements during a mission, as well as, significantly reducing the cycle time between situational awareness and taking decisive action. This paper outlines our approach which employs dynamic case-based reasoning and a computer generated forces testbed, which are integrated within the overall system architecture. We present initial findings and results concerning the development of our SDSS with reference to an advance to contact military scenario employed in land operations.","","0-7803-9286-8","10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591968","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1591968","Decision Support;Critical Success Factors;Soft Computing;Computer Generated Forces;Information Fusion","Decision support systems;Decision making;Military computing;Fusion power generation;Fuzzy reasoning;Decision theory;System testing;Computer architecture;Modems;Artificial intelligence","case-based reasoning;decision support systems;sensor fusion;uncertainty handling;fuzzy logic;military computing","smart decision support system;SDSS;parsimonious information fusion;military decision making;critical success factor;CSF;soft computing technique;commander intuitive decision;dynamic case-based reasoning;computer generated forces testbed;Information Fusion Defence Technology Centre Consortium;UK","","6","","33","IEEE","13 Feb 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We divide Galex into three progressively fine-grained levels: discipline, area, and institution levels. The combination of interactions enables analysts to explore an arbitrary piece of history and an arbitrary part of the knowledge space of one discipline. Using a flexible spotlight component, analysts could freely select and quickly understand an exploration region.

We investigate the security of three types of Android Apps including finance, shopping and browser which are closely related to human life. And we analyze four vulnerabilities including Improper certificate validation(CWE-295:ICV), WebView bypass certificate validation vulnerability(CVE-2014-5531:WBCVV), WebView remote code execution vulnerability(CVE-2014-1939:WRCEV) and Alibaba Cloud OSS credential disclosure vulnerability(CNVD-2017-09774:ACOCDV). In order to verify the effectiveness of our analysis method in large-scale Apps on the Internet, we propose a novel scalable tool - VulArcher, which is based on heuristic method and used to discover if the above vulnerabilities exist in Apps. We download a total of 6114 of the above three types of samples in App stores, and we use VulArcher to perform the above vulnerability detection for each App. We perform manual verification by randomly selecting 100 samples of each vulnerability.

This analysis motivates the second issue: how much computational time is available for executing the acoustic process, assuming the requirement for perceptually perfect audiovisual synchronization? A psychoacoustic experiment designed to quantify the tolerable audiovisual delay indicates that an acoustic impact event must occur within an average of 175 ms of the visual event in order for the events to be perceived as synchronous. The most highly trained observers detect desynchrony with an audiovisual delay as low as 100 ms. The results of the computational requirement analysis and the psychoacoustic synchronization experiment provide important information for designers and researchers of virtual acoustic displays.","1054-7460","","10.1162/105474698565802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6788177","","","","","","6","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

This applies in particular when short time-to-market constraints impose serious limitations on the exploration of the design space. The use of virtual platforms can help in decreasing the development cycles. In this paper, we present a cloud-based environment allowing the design of virtual platforms and prototyping of the system including complex software with prerecorded data or testbenches. Afterwards, the created design can also be synthesized for Xilinx FPGAs. Additionally, this paper presents the use of this remote virtual prototyping environment in a hardware-related programming laboratory with more than 350 participating undergraduate students. This large number of attendees leads to a lot of issues regarding the supervisory relationship as well as providing enough hardware resources in terms of boards. Nevertheless, we want to give the students hands-on experience when programming an embedded system on an FPGA-board. The cloud-based infrastructure allows us to respond to these difficulties by implementing a Software-in-the-Loop simulation based on an instruction set simulator. Doing so the students can design and implement their codes for the targeted architecture and prototype and debug it on a virtual platform. Since the course is mandatory we expect many students with limited experience about hardware-related programming.

Invisibility is one of these NFRs, and it refers to either the merging of technology in the user environment or the decrease of the interaction workload. This new NFR may impact traditional NFRs (e.g., Usability), revealing positive correlations, when one NFR helps another, and negative correlations, when a procedure favors an NFR but creates difficulty for another one. Software engineers need to know about these correlations, so they can select appropriate strategies to satisfy Invisibility and traditional NFRs. Correlations between NFRs are usually stored in catalogs, which is a well-defined body of knowledge gathered from previous experience. Although Invisibility has been recently cataloged with development strategies, the literature still lacks catalogs with correlations for this NFR. Therefore, this work aims at capturing and cataloging invisibility correlations for UbiComp and IoT systems. To do that, we also propose to systematize the definition of correlations using the following well-defined research methods: Interview, Content Analysis and Questionnaire. As a result, we defined a catalog with 110 positive and negative correlations with 9 NFRs. This well-defined body of knowledge is useful for supporting software engineers to select strategies to satisfy Invisibility and other NFRs related to user interaction.","2332-6441","978-1-7281-7438-9","10.1109/RE48521.2020.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218217","invisibility;correlation;cooperation;conflict;non-functional requirement;catalog","Correlation;Pervasive computing;Usability;Interviews;Security;Internet of Things;Human computer interaction","formal specification;human computer interaction;Internet of Things;software engineering","user interaction;ubiquitous computing;UbiComp;nonfunctional requirements;human-computer interaction;user environment;interaction workload;invisibility correlations;Internet of Things;HCI;IoT systems;content analysis","","5","","48","IEEE","9 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the high computation cost of rendering real-time animation twice (for both eyes) and the resource limitation of wearable devices, VR applications often face performance bottlenecks and performanceoptimization plays an important role in VR software develop-ment. Performance optimizations of VR applications can be very different from those in traditional software as VR involves more elements such as graphics rendering and real-time animation. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on 183 real-world performance optimizations from 45 VR software projects. In particular, we manually categorized the optimizations in to 11 categories, and applied static analysis to identify how they affect different life-cycle phases of VR applications. Furthermore, we studied the complexity and design / behavior effects of performance optimizations, and how optimizations are different between large organizational software projects and smaller personal software projects. Our major findings include: (1) graphics simplification (24.0%), rendering optimization (16.9%), language / API optimization (15.3%), heap avoidance (14.8%), and valuecaching (12.0%) are the most common categories of performance optimization in VR applications; (2) game logic updates (30.4%) and before-scene initialization (20.0%) are the most common life-cycle phases affected by performance issues; (3) 45.9% of the optimizations have behavior and design effects and 39.3% of the optimizations are systematic changes; (4) the distributionsof optimization classes are very different between organizational VR projects and personal VR projects.","1558-1225","978-1-6654-0296-5","10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402052","Empirical Study;Virtual Reality;Performance Optimization","Rendering (computer graphics);Animation;Software;Real-time systems;Complexity theory;Optimization;Software engineering","application program interfaces;program diagnostics;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","optimization commits;open source unity projects;real-time animation;VR applications;performance bottlenecks;VR software development;performance optimization;real-world performance optimizations;VR software projects;life-cycle phases;organizational software projects;organizational VR projects;personal VR projects;virtual reality applications;optimization classes;personal software projects","","5","","60","IEEE","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we define a typical use case envisaged in the early stage of the 5G system rollout, where users can experience 100M+ data rate in the target area and at the same time enjoy services demanding extremely high data rates, such as virtual reality and ultra-high definition video. We then break down the use case into four different traffic types: web browsing, content sharing, virtual reality experience and ultra-high definition video, and derive and analyze the distributions of the required instantaneous data rates for each individual traffic type.

This approach is termed autonomous integrated prototyping. The main contribution of this paper is the development of an intelligent system architecture to facilitate and guide the product development autonomously and simultaneously in both VP and PP environments. The seamless connection between VP and PP, along with KBSs, enables the exploration of new behaviors of developing systems and analyzing different behaviors.

However, supporting runtime sharing with tenant-specific functional and performance variations in an SIMT application is challenging. We propose an approach, Software-Defined Service Networking (SDSN), to addressing this challenge. SDSN realizes an SIMT application with a managed service network (SN) and a set of managed virtual service networks (VSNs) that share the SN. The SN connects a set of services according to their capability and interoperability. To achieve the requirements of a particular tenant, a VSN uses a subset of the services under a particular architecture and a control policy. We describe how the SN and its VSNs are designed and enacted to achieve the SIMT objectives. We show the feasibility of the SDSN, demonstrate the utilization benefits it achieves, and quantify the runtime overhead it incurs.","","978-1-4673-7281-7","10.1109/SCC.2015.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207355","Virtual Service Network;Multi-Tenant;SaaS;Cloud Service;Software-Defined Network","Tin;Collaboration;Vehicles;Throughput;Runtime;Contracts","cloud computing;computer network management;open systems;software architecture;software defined networking","software-defined service networking;runtime sharing;performance differentiation;multitenant SaaS applications;service-based SaaS application;economies of scale;partner services sharing;single-instance multitenancy model;SIMT model;SDSN;service network management;SN management;virtual service networks;VSN;interoperability;architecture;control policy;SIMT objectives;runtime overhead","","5","","31","IEEE","20 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper targets this twin challenge and proposes novel architecture aspects as well as new approaches for discovery and communication scheduling enabling optimum system performance with DRX alignment and meeting varied QoS targets.

When the total demand placed on system resources by the tasks, for a given interval of time, exceeds the resources available, some tasks will receive degraded service or no service at all. One part of a measure to quantify the success of a resource management system (RMS) in such a distributed environment is the collective value of the tasks completed during an interval of time, as perceived by the user, application, or policy maker. The flexible integrated system capability (FISC) ratio introduced here is a measure for quantifying this collective value. The FISC ratio is a multi-dimensional measure, and may include priorities, versions of a task or data, deadlines, situational mode, security, application- and domain-specific QoS, and dependencies. In addition to being used for evaluating and comparing RMS, the FISC ratio can be incorporated as part of the objective function in a system's scheduling heuristics.","","0-7695-0500-7","10.1109/EMPDP.2000.823388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=823388","","Degradation;Resource management;Indium tin oxide;Computer networks;Reactive power;Time measurement;Q measurement;ISO;Contracts;Quality of service","quality of service;computer network management;performance evaluation;security of data","QoS performance measure framework;distributed heterogeneous networks;distributed heterogeneous computing environment;resource allocation;resource management system;flexible integrated system capability ratio;multi-dimensional measure;priorities;data versions;task versions;deadlines;situational mode;security;application-specific QoS;domain-specific QoS","","5","","31","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Optimizing the energy efficiency of games is hence critical for battery-limited mobile devices. Although the advent of energy-aware scheduling (EAS) integrated in recent devices has provided opportunities for improved energy management, the framework is not specifically tuned for game applications. In this paper, we aim to improve the energy efficiency of game applications running on EAS-enabled mobile devices. To this end, we first analyze the functional characteristics of games, and investigate the source of the energy inefficiency. We then propose a scheme, called System-level Energy-optimization for Game Applications (SEGA), to improve the energy efficiency of games. SEGA governs CPU and GPU power consumption in a tightly coupled manner by employing three key techniques: (1) Lsync-aware GPU DVFS governor, (2) adaptive capacity clamping, and (3) on-demand touch boosting. We implemented SEGA on the latest Android-based smartphones. The evaluation results for 23 popular games showed that SEGA reduced the energy consumption of the Google Pixel 2 XL and Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus smartphones, at the device level, by 6.1–22.3 and 4.0–11.7 percent, respectively, with a quality of service (QoS) degradation of 1.1 and 0.5 percent, on average.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3058381","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1A2C2004619); Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion; Korea government MSIT(grant numbers:2018-0-00532); Development of High-Assurance; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9352566","Game applications;smartphones;energy-aware scheduling;energy efficiency","Games;Graphics processing units;Task analysis;Energy efficiency;Land mobile radio;Energy consumption;Clamps","computer games;energy conservation;energy consumption;graphics processing units;microprocessor chips;mobile computing;power aware computing;power consumption;quality of service;scheduling;smart phones","energy consumption;mobile games;energy-intensive applications;energy efficiency;energy-aware scheduling;energy management;game applications;EAS-enabled mobile devices;energy inefficiency;SEGA;system-level energy-optimization;CPU;GPU power consumption;Lsync-aware GPU DVFS governor;adaptive capacity clamping;on-demand touch boosting;Android-based smartphones;Google Pixel 2 XL;Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus smartphones;quality of service;QoS","","4","","46","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we explore a new VR interaction method based on electrovibration technology with a touch screen and conduct evaluations about it. The key idea is to incorporate a set of manipulation gestures and three types of electrovibration in the VR interaction to help users acquire different kinds of tactile perception in the virtual manipulation. We present the evaluation in which we compare user performance measured first in a Fitts law task to evaluate different electrovibration types and then in a virtual office application to assess the interactive user interface. Our results show that the precision of interactions is significantly improved with the electrovibration haptic feedback.

Virtual Reality Training (VRT) as a training tool for example, expresses potential capabilities to improve the learning curve, increasing trainee confidence and acquisition of skills. However, the success of this tool highly depends on how close this tool is to the reality. Ontology is called as a significant modelling tool which can help to provide a shared and common understanding of a domain, and in this scenario, a standardized terminology for representing the training domain, and actions taking place in Virtual Environment (VE). Recent Systematic Literature Review (SLR) findings show that most ontology designs for VRT are not built systematically and there is no ontology describing the domain knowledge for VRT in the ophthalmology field. There is also a lack of a high achievement rate in implementing ontology driven VRT, calls for systematic and comprehensive steps. Therefore, in order to lower the failure rate of ontology applied to VRT, OntoPhaco was designed and developed based on philosophically grounded foundational ontologies, namely, Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and Design & Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO). The evaluation results showed that the use of OntoPhaco was able to improve the student’s learning experience, assist effectively in building VR training scenarios, and lead to a successful VRT processes. The lessons learnt from designing OntoPhaco for this domain could generally generate valuable contribution to the theory and practice of VRT, knowledge management and ontology engineering in complex domains.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126697","Transdisciplinary Research Grant Scheme (TRGS), Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)(grant numbers:TRGS/1/2020/UKM/02/6/2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606920","Ontology applications;virtual reality;training and education","Ontologies;Training;Surgery;Cataracts;Ophthalmology;Tools;Systematics","computer based training;health care;knowledge management;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);surgery;virtual reality","OntoPhaco;VR training scenarios;ontology engineering;complex domains;virtual reality training;safe cataract surgery;successful cataract surgery;effective training programs;public healthcare providers;private healthcare providers;training tool;trainee confidence;significant modelling tool;shared understanding;common understanding;training domain;virtual environment;ontology designs;domain knowledge;ophthalmology field;high achievement rate;ontology driven VRT;systematic steps;comprehensive steps;philosophically grounded foundational ontologies;VRT processes;ophthalmology domain","","3","","68","CCBY","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model aims to solve the problems arising from the lack of integrity, inability to decompose SoS’s capability in a static way and untimely verification of SoS’s capability when the traditional V-model of systems engineering is applied to SoSE. This V+ model divides the SoSE process into two levels, the SoS level and the system level.

Therefore, we co-developed novel virtual reality (VR) interactions together with patients and clinical experts, which can be easily performed by patients without extensive instructions.

Hence, when selecting an appropriate variant, we have to fulfill also non-functional requirements. Since more systems are interconnected, the challenge is to find a variant that additionally satisfies global nonfunctional (or quality) requirements.

We will argue that human beings are just about to move one step forward due to continued progress in information and communication technology (ICT). Current and upcoming developments are producing a huge amount of information and knowledge that should be ubiquitously available to everyone for various scenarios and arrangements. This fact has deep implications for all individuals themselves, but particularly also for design and implementation of technological models for virtual learning that should satisfy individual user differences by respecting user strategies, self-regulation and learning management. The consideration of the conceptual background involves new advanced aspects of presentation and interaction with information as well as their implementation for enhancing the Web-based learning performance. It reflects individualization facilities and points out the significance of complex interactivity, demonstrating how the concept can be used to improve learning design efforts in education. Dealing with this matter, this paper focuses on the bridging between a Web-enabled strategy for learning reflecting individualization aspects, and the related interface design along with the required level of security, safety and privacy. Good and reliable interface design allows the user to accomplish a variety of tasks, and to operate intuitively and individually. At the same time, it can gain the attention, and help to select and access the desired adequate information. By making use of it, this strategy helps increasing the users' awareness, confidence, and acceptance towards system and educational application - a prerequisite for nowadays e-learning success stories.

To reduce time complexity, we further present a heuristic matching algorithm for determining whether the current stationary scheme is optimal in an off-line.

The aim of SOA is to automate web service tasks, such as, web service discovery, selection, composition and execution. Since XML is a syntax-based language, the automation of these tasks is still a challenge. To overcome this, web services can be described semantically using an ontology description language, e.g., Web Ontology Language (OWL), giving rise to semantic web services (SWS). Because semantic web services are relatively new, there has been little research into testing and quality assurance aspects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating test cases based on user requirements for testing semantic web services. In SWS frameworks, such as, Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO), the user requirements are presented as a goal specification in terms of a state model. We use a model checking approach to generate test cases from this state model. To achieve this, we represent a set of rules for translation from a goal specification to a formal B abstract state machine. The B representation of the goal specification is given as input to the model checker to generate concrete test cases using the assertion violation property of the model checker. Finally, the proposed framework is evaluated using a real world case study based on, the Amazon E-commerce Service.","","978-1-4244-5618-5","10.1109/SEEFM.2009.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5465136","","Testing;Semantic Web;Web services;Service oriented architecture;XML;Ontologies;OWL;Simple object access protocol;Automation;Quality assurance","finite state machines;formal specification;formal verification;knowledge representation languages;semantic Web;software architecture;Web services;XML","model checking;XML protocols;WSDL;SOAP;UDDI;service oriented architecture;ontology description language;Web Ontology Language;quality assurance;semantic Web service testing;Web Service Modelling Ontology;formal B abstract state machine;Amazon e-commerce service;syntax-based language","","3","","21","IEEE","18 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a study of user requirements related to interaction with the stereoscopic 3D video. The study suggests that the change of view, zoom in/out, dynamic video browsing and textual information are the most relevant interactions with stereoscopic 3D video. In addition, we identified a strong demand for object selection that resulted in a follow-up study of user preferences in 3D selection using virtual-hand and ray-casting metaphors. These results indicate that interaction modality affects users' decision of object selection in terms of chosen location in 3D, while user attitudes do not have significant impact. Furthermore, the ray-casting based interaction using Wiimote can outperform the volume-based interaction technique using mouse and keyboard for object positioning accuracy.","","978-1-4673-2027-6","10.1109/ICMEW.2012.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6266227","3D television (3DTV);3D stereoscopic;3D video interaction;User requirement;Interactive functionality;Interaction modality","Stereo image processing;Accuracy;Correlation;Analysis of variance;Mice;Keyboards;User interfaces","stereo image processing;three-dimensional television","user requirement elicitation;stereoscopic 3D video interaction;three dimensional display technologies;3D video production;broadcasting;2D video interactions;zoom in-out;dynamic video browsing;textual information;virtual-hand metaphors;ray-casting metaphors;ray-casting based interaction;object positioning;volume-based interaction technique","","2","","11","IEEE","16 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three major features that distinguish VR systems are real-time performance while maintaining acceptable realism and presence, objects with two clearly distinct yet inter-related aspects like geometry/structure and function/behavior, and the still experimental nature of multi-modal interaction design. Until now, little attention has been paid to methods and tools for the structured development of VR software that addresses these features. Many VR application development projects proceed by modeling needed objects on conventional CAD systems, then programming the system using simulation packages. Usually, these activities are carried out without much planning, which may be acceptable for only small-scale or noncritical demonstration systems. However, for VR to be taken seriously as a media technology, a structural approach to developing VR applications is required for the construction of large-scale VR worlds, and this will undoubtedly involve and require complex resource management, abstractions for basic system/object functionalities and interaction tasks, and integration and easy plug-ins of different input and output methods. In this paper, we assembled a comprehensive structured methodology for building VR systems, called CLEVR (Concurrent and LEvel by Level Development of VR System), which combines several conventional and new concepts. For instance, we employ concepts such as the simultaneous consideration of form, function, and behavior, hierarchical modeling and top-down creation of LODs (levels of detail), incremental execution and performance tuning, user task and interaction modeling, and compositional reuse of VR objects. The basic underlying modeling approach is to design VR objects (and the scenes they compose) hierarchically and incrementally, considering their realism, presence, behavioral correctness, performance, and even usability in a spiral manner. To support this modeling strategy, we developed a collection of computeraided tools called P-VoT (POSTECH-Virtual reality system development Tool). We demonstrate our approach by illustrating a step-by-step design of a virtual ship simulator using the CLEVR/P-VoT, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of the quality (performance and correctness) of the resulting software and reduced effort in its development and maintenance.","1054-7460","","10.1162/105474602760204291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6790913","","","","","","2","2","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

We report upon three examples of cognitive gameplay definition and propose a definition for cognitive gameplay requirements, capable of capturing the requirements from within the case study, that can be used as the basis for further investigations.","2157-0264","978-1-4244-8766-0","10.1109/REV.2010.5625658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625658","Experience requirements;design requirements;non-functional requirements;gameplay requirements;cognitive requirements;videogame","Games;Production;Book reviews;Context;Computer science;Rendering (computer graphics);Industries","cognition;computer games;software engineering;systems analysis","cognitive gameplay requirement;game development team;implementation-and-test technique","","2","","18","IEEE","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing approaches in this domain typically rely on manual video analysis and formation discussion using whiteboards; or expert systems that rely on state-of-the-art video and trajectory visualization techniques and advanced user interaction. We bridge the gap between these approaches by contributing a light-weight, simplified interaction and visualization system, which we conceptualized in an iterative design study with the coaching team of a European first league soccer team. Our approach is walk-up usable by all domain stakeholders, and at the same time, can leverage advanced data retrieval and analysis techniques: a virtual magnetic tactic-board. Users place and move digital magnets on a virtual tactic-board, and these interactions get translated to spatio-temporal queries, used to retrieve relevant situations from massive team movement data. Despite such seemingly imprecise query input, our approach is highly usable, supports quick user exploration, and retrieval of relevant results via query relaxation. Appropriate simplified result visualization supports in-depth analyses to explore team behavior, such as formation detection, movement analysis, and what-if analysis. We evaluated our approach with several experts from European first league soccer clubs. The results show that our approach makes the complex analytical processes needed for the identification of tactical behavior directly accessible to domain experts for the first time, demonstrating our support of coaches in preparation for future encounters.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3134814","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9647932","Sport analytics;soccer analytics;visual analytics","Sports;Visualization;Data visualization;Magnetic domains;Trajectory;Europe;Data analysis","data analysis;data visualisation;expert systems;human computer interaction;human factors;iterative methods;query processing;sport","advanced user interaction;data analysis;data retrieval;European first league soccer clubs;European first league soccer team;expert systems;formation discussion;iterative design;manual video analysis;massive soccer datasets;massive team movement data;query relaxation;sketchplan;spatio-temporal queries;tactical behavior identification;trajectory visualization;video visualization;virtual magnetic tactic-board;whiteboards","Soccer;Athletic Performance;Computer Graphics;Movement;Walking","2","","79","IEEE","13 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A way to select a subset from a test suite is thus extremely essential to save cost and provide confidence that the program modifications are correct. Though substantial research results on test selection techniques have been reported in the literature, very few software industries deploy systematic test selection strategies or automation support. The expert judgment is the most often used in the industry for identification of relevant cases for re-testing that is usually difficult and inefficient. This paper introduces an agile strategy that divides a test suite with Equivalence Classification Partition (ECP) into sub-domains. The subset selected from the sub-domains provides a complete and comprehensive coverage of test criteria. The ECP is expressed with Classification Tree Method (CTM) and easy to be adjusted for different goals flexibly, e.g., re-test for modified function, delivery deadline or human resource limit. Our method is implemented as a tool and evaluated on two projects experimentally. The results demonstrated that this method can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of re-testing greatly.","","978-1-5090-0290-0","10.1109/DCIT.2015.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7434468","Test selection;Equivalence Classification Partition;Classification Tree Method","Testing;Software;Minimization;Industries;Manuals;Internet of things;Systematics","DP industry;equivalence classes;software maintenance;trees (mathematics)","equivalence class partitioning;software maintenance activities;program modifications;test selection techniques;software industries;equivalence classification partition;ECP;classification tree method;CTM","","2","","23","IEEE","17 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent advancements, especially in optics, made it possible to perform this procedure in an ambulatory, outpatient setting without anaesthesia. Yet, such approach introduces additional challenges to gynecologists, as the surgical instruments have to pass through the cervix, a narrow curved canal. This process can be traumatic and even cause tissue damage or rupture. Current training curricula mainly focus on general minimally-invasive surgical skills or on inpatient hysteroscopy. This paper describes the first virtual reality training system designed purposely for in-office hysteroscopy training featuring both passive and active haptic feedback. Design requirements were defined through a literature review and a survey of clinical experts. A dedicated platform was developed and tested with clinicians and medical students. The results of the conducted experiments verified the skill acquisition capabilities of the platform showing a.o. shorter execution time and path length, lower integral forces in most of non-expert participants. The results also demonstrated the capability of the system to differentiate between experts and non-expert groups. Reported findings suggest that the platform has the potential to evolve into an effective solution for in-office hysteroscopy training.","2576-3202","","10.1109/TMRB.2022.3188438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9841088","Surgical training;haptic display system;gynecology;in-office hysteroscopy;virtual reality;force feedback","Haptic interfaces;Training;Irrigation;Medical robotics;Instruments;Biomimetics;Bibliographies","biological tissues;biomedical education;computer based training;gynaecology;haptic interfaces;medical computing;surgery;training;virtual reality","gynecological procedure;intrauterine pathologies;minimally-invasive approach;outpatient setting;surgical instruments;narrow curved canal;tissue damage;current training curricula;inpatient hysteroscopy;virtual reality training system;in-office hysteroscopy training;passive feedback;active haptic feedback;skill acquisition capabilities;in-office hysteroscopy VR-haptic simulation platform;cervical canal passage;general minimally-invasive surgical skills;medical students;clinicians students","","2","","51","IEEE","26 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No.99CB37098)","6 Aug 2002","1999","","","1","10","In common with many large institutes, CERN has traditionally developed and maintained its own data management solutions. Recently, a significant change of direction has taken place and we have now adopted commercial tools, together with a small amount of site-specific code, for this task. The solutions chosen were originally studied as part of research and development projects oriented towards the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is currently under construction at CERN. They have since been adopted not only by the LHC collaborations, which are due to take production data starting in 2005, but also by numerous current experiments, both at CERN and at other High Energy Physics laboratories. Previous experiments, that used data management tools developed in-house, are also studying a possible move to the new environment. To meet the needs of today's experiments, data rates of up to 35 MB/second and data volumes of many hundred TB per experiment must be supported. Data distribution to multiple sites must be provided together with concurrent access for up to some 100 users. Meeting these requirements provides a convenient stepping stone towards those of the LHC, where data rates of 100-1500 MB/second must be supported, together with data volumes of up to 20 PB per experiment. We describe the current status of the production systems, database administration tools that have been developed, typically using the Java binding to the database, data distribution techniques and the performance characteristics of the system. Mechanisms to permit users to find and navigate through their data are discussed, including the issues of naming and meta-data and associated browsers. Coupled to the data management solution is a complete data analysis environment. This too is largely based on commercial, standards-conforming components with application-specific extensions as required. We discuss our experience in using such solutions including issues related to the integration of several commercial packages. Costs and risk factors are described, as well as issues related to responsiveness of the vendors to enhancement requests and support for additional platforms. Finally, we discuss the extent to which we have succeeded in our goal of using commodity solutions and the advantages of a database, as opposed to a file-based, approach for the management of vast volumes of data.","1051-9173","0-7695-0204-0","10.1109/MASS.1999.829965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=829965","","Large Hadron Collider;Databases;Environmental management;Research and development;Collaboration;Laboratories;Production systems;Java;Navigation;Data analysis","naming services;database management systems;meta data;very large databases","data management;CERN;Large Hadron Collider;database;commercial packages;data analysis environment;naming;meta-data;browsers","","2","","18","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A high degree of cost consciousness in all network operation sectors is therefore essential. Our basic concern in the field of telecom energy (power supply, heating, ventilation and cooling) is the creation of a complete energy system designed to serve the telecom process. Rapidly changing market conditions call for energy systems capable of greater functionality and availability, faster delivery and commissioning, and better manageability, quality and service. The Telecom Energy Division of Telia AB (f. Swedish Telecom) recently completed a project entitled Compact Power Formats Meet Changing Conditions. The project task - to find answers to the issues outlined above - entailed the evaluation of a number of different power system concepts based on recent technological developments in power conversion and telecommunications. The concept which in our view best met the requirements of adaptability to rapidly changing conditions has now been described in detail, complete with purchasing specifications. The project has defined the compact power format as the concept most appropriate to our needs. Its key property is flexibility, a crucial factor in the face of changing market conditions. An exhaustive exploration of a number of critical aspects revealed major advantages for the compact power format.

They add directly to the cost base, impact manufacturing firms' responsiveness and contribute to the overall product quality. Computer-aided intelligent fixture design was developed over the years to give a competitive edge to the manufacturing firms who are facing unprecedented competition and challenges. Among the techniques, case-based reasoning (CBR) method leverages previous design experience and emerged as one of the most popular methods. However, existing CBR methods are more focused on frame work building and less on detailed techniques on case retrieving, which is the central part of any CBR methods. This would inevitably impose negative impact on the overall efficiency of any CBR-based methods. In light of this, this paper presents a new case retrieving method based on a constrained common subgraph technique. This technique tracks down similar cases from a case library through comparing the maximal common subgraphs constrained by meeting fixturing functional requirement. Efficient and robust algorithms have been developed subsequently to implement this technique. The developed method can be highly effective for retrieving cases related to some manufacturing parts with complex geometry. An illustrative example, combined with other key fixture design factors, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The presented method is intuitive and can be used in combination with existing CBR methods and well positioned for the upcoming “big data” manufacturing.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2017.2674961","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51105075,51575107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886298","Algorithm;case retrieving;case-based reasoning (CBR);constrained common subgraph;face adjacent graph (FAG);fixture design;graph matching;graph similarity;machining features;maximal common subgraph (MCS);tolerance","Manufacturing;Machining;Algorithm design and analysis;Fixtures;Cognition;Product design","Big Data;CAD;case-based reasoning;design engineering;fixtures;graphs;manufacturing systems;product quality;production engineering computing","product quality;constrained common subgraph technique;maximal common subgraphs;manufacturing firms;big data;computer-aided intelligent fixture design;case retrieving method;robust algorithms","","1","","55","IEEE","24 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, rehabilitation treatment of ankle injury has attracted more and more attentions. There are some limitations for traditional training methods, such as the training monotony, the large human consumption and the difficulty to quantify the training effects. In this paper, a virtual reality-based training system for ankle joint rehabilitation is designed. By combining an aircraft roaming virtual reality game with the rehabilitation training, the subjects' enthusiasm during rehabilitation can be improved, which leads to positive effects on rehabilitation training. Training data is saved for quantitative assessment of rehabilitation. In addition, this paper proposes a rehabilitation assessment method based on multi-index fusion of kinematics and electromyography (EMG) signals. The method includes three indexes, namely, root mean square of EMG, joint activity and joint smoothness. Experimental results prove that the proposed indexes can distinguish the subjects' healthy side from the affected side.","","978-1-5386-7672-1","10.1109/PIC.2018.8706143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8706143","ankle joint;virtual reality;training system;rehabilitation","Training;Electromyography;Software;Hardware;Games;Indexes;Aircraft","electromyography;gait analysis;injuries;kinematics;medical computing;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;virtual reality","virtual reality-based training system;ankle rehabilitation;ankle joints;rehabilitation treatment;ankle injury;traditional training methods;training monotony;training effects;ankle joint rehabilitation;aircraft roaming virtual reality game;rehabilitation training;training data;rehabilitation assessment method;EMG;root mean square;joint smoothness;joint activity","","1","","20","IEEE","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each of the thousand plus dance styles in existence across the globe come with their own movements and patterns; yet they all depend on synchronization with music beats. Dance moves are choreographed for certain moves to occur on certain beats of the music with a certain tempo. A challenge of learning any dance style is keeping track of the music beats. SwingBeats is a real time, haptic feedback system under research an development that helps dancers stay on beat with the music. As a supplemental training tool for new dancers who have no formal background in music or dance it enables the learner to dance to any music even if they have never heard that music before and thus broadens the spectrum of music one can dance to. SwingBeats teaches learners to move their bodies to the beat of the music and thus intuitively develop a sense of beat and rhythm. In doing so, it helps learners become better dancers more quickly.","","978-1-7281-2355-4","10.1109/HAVE.2019.8921326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8921326","Beat Detection;Dance Education;Haptic Feedback;Internet of Things;Metronome;Wearable","Haptic interfaces;Vibrations;Rhythm;Synchronization;Education;Tracking","computer aided instruction;haptic interfaces;humanities;learning (artificial intelligence);teaching","SwingBeats;real-time haptic beat tracking system;dance education;dance style;music beats;dance moves;haptic feedback system","","1","","25","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

NASA research engineers and subject matter experts have been tasked with developing the ground test protocol that will serve as the primary means by which these Phase 2 prototypes will be systematically evaluated. The purpose of a common ground test protocol for the Phase 2 Habitation Concepts is to consistently evaluate different commercial partner ground prototypes to provide data-driven, actionable recommendations for Phase 3. This paper describes the process by which the ground test protocol was developed and the objectives, methods, and metrics by which the NextSTEP Phase 2 Habitation Concepts will be assessed. Ground test evaluations will include human-in-the-loop (HITL) habitation tests, subsystem standalone tests, analyses, and inspections. HITL testing will involve crews of four astronauts conducting multiday mission timelines that integrate all habitation operations (e.g., eating, sleeping, waste collection system operations, exercise), representative science and robotics tasks (e.g., low-latency teleoperations rover operations, sample return, life science, medical evaluations), and extravehicular activity (EVA), (e.g., airlock configuration, pre/post operations). Established subjective and objective metrics will be collected and analyzed to provide the data and actionable recommendations for Phase 3 of the NextSTEP program. This paper begins with a summary of NASA's deep space habitation plans, the goals of the NASA NextSTEP activity, and the process by which the ground test objectives were derived. It then details the strategic questions and hypotheses, and describes the inspections, analyses, subsystem standalone tests, and HITL integrated tests that will be used to address the functional requirements and ground test objectives. Data collected from these assessments will be analyzed to determine the acceptability of habitation element configurations and the combinations of capabilities that will result in the best habitation platform to be recommended by the test team for Phase 3.","","978-1-5386-2014-4","10.1109/AERO.2018.8396513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396513","","NASA;Space missions;Space vehicles;Logic gates;Protocols;Analytical models","aerospace robotics;planetary rovers;space research;space vehicles","deep space exploration capabilities;human spaceflight missions;cislunar space;NASA research engineers;subject matter experts;Phase 2 prototypes;common ground test protocol;actionable recommendations;ground test evaluations;human-in-the-loop habitation tests;subsystem standalone tests;HITL testing;habitation operations;collection system operations;low-latency teleoperations rover operations;medical evaluations;established subjective metrics;objective metrics;NextSTEP program;NASA NextSTEP activity;ground test objectives;HITL integrated tests;habitation element configurations;habitation platform;test team;ground test & analysis protocol;public-private partnership model;commercial development;commercial partner ground prototypes;NASA deep space habitation plans;NASA NextSTEP phase 2 habitation concepts;best habitation platform;NASA Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships","","1","","21","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is believed that the development of AR scenarios is a difficult task, requiring knowledge and understanding in several areas. With this, the disciplines of Software Engineering play a fundamental role in the development of these scenarios. The teaching of requirements and concepts of elicitation is primordial in the first years of the courses of Computing. A systematic review to map the use of Requirements Engineering in the development of AR scenarios pointed to a gap regarding the requirements elicitation process for AR, which led us to think of a teaching strategy to help undergraduate students to specify AR scenario requirements. Therefore, in 2016, we conducted experimental tests at the University Technological Federal of Paraná with the undergraduate students of Systems Analysis and Development and Software Engineering, to present a strategy that would contribute to the elicitation of requirements for RA scenarios. These experimental tests verified the strategy, and the results indicate if it is possible to help the students in the elicitation of requirements for AR scenarios from this approach..","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658529","Augmented Reality;Requirements;Process","Software;Software engineering;Augmented reality;Education;Requirements engineering;Virtual environments;Systematics","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;educational courses;formal specification;systems analysis;teaching","undergraduate students;design thinking context;tangible actions;multimodal operations;AR scenarios;requirements elicitation process;teaching strategy;AR scenario requirements;software engineering;requirements engineering;augmented reality software;teaching multidisciplinary teams requirements;systems analysis;computing course","","1","","16","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, therapists are often tightly scheduled and their work is very demanding, thus new therapeutic systems should reduce their workload and improve life of patients at the same time. While patients with dementia or Alzheimer's disease should not use VR Exergames on their own, therapist need to be in control of the games flow and be able to react to mood shifts and current capabilities of the patient. In this paper, we present our co-developed VR exergame for older adults with dementia and their therapist to improve cognition through everyday exercise and complement continual biography work by cooperative experience. The older adults visit their community room and solve motor-cognitive tasks in stereoscopic 360° videos, while experience and difficulty can be dynamically controlled by the therapists.","","978-1-7281-6532-5","10.1109/VRW50115.2020.00078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9090439","Human-centered computing;Human computer interaction (HCI);HCI design and evaluation methods;User studies;Human-centered computing;Human computer interaction (HCI);Interaction paradigms;Collaborative interaction","Games;Dementia;Task analysis;Hospitals;Neurological diseases","biomechanics;biomedical equipment;cognition;computer games;diseases;geriatrics;neurophysiology;patient treatment;virtual reality","Alzheimer disease;VR Exergames;VR exergame;dementia;everyday exercise;complement continual biography work;motor-cognitive tasks;enabling patients;neurological diseases;motor-cognitive Exergames;clinical supervision;immersive group-based virtual reality;therapeutic systems","","1","","13","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though the entry of wearable computer into the computer world was not so remarkable and admirable, it is getting attracted by the current civilization day by day for the realization of its requirements for the future world. A person busy with several workloads at the same time likes to acquire much more output from the same span of time and wearable computer substantiates this type of un-restriction. This is one of the most important and salient features of wearable computer and this type of typical, goal oriented requirements of wearable computer are the point of discussion of this paper. An empirical study of the requirements of wearable computer has been done in the SoftWEAR project led by University of Hohenheim and IAO, Fraunhofer, Stuttgart.

Our VR system supports the workflow of digital restoration by offering a configurable self-arranging fragment wall. It supports the user to organize all fragments in an overview representation and to identify relevant fragments quickly. For assembly, we implemented a jigsaw approach comprising two sets of manipulation techniques that allow the user to roughly align fragments first in sub-puzzles and precisely assemble them in a second step. The iterative development and assembling process was accompanied by a professional restorer.

However, the changing of requirements often occurs in the development phase, which causes an effect on the software testing. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a framework for impact analysis of test cases based on changes of use case based requirement specification. The proposed approach verifies and validates the difference of requirement specification which is described in use case pattern on two versions of requirement specification document. Consequently, the patterns of the variable requirements changing to be classified and analysed. These results enable the existing test cases completely reused, partly updated as well as additionally generated. In addition, generating new test case completely supports testing coverage and eliminates test case redundancy by using the effective CCTM method.","","978-1-7281-2544-2","10.1109/ICSEC47112.2019.8974699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8974699","Test case;Impact analysis;Equivalence Class Partitioning;Classification Tree Method;Black-Box testing","","formal specification;program testing;program verification;software quality","software testing life cycle;test case generation;use case based requirement specification;requirement specification document;impact analysis framework;software quality","","1","","17","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing works mainly consider the RIS as a whole uniform plane, which may be unrealistic to be installed on the facade of buildings when the RIS is extreme large. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a sparse array of sub-surface (SAoS) architecture for RIS, which contains several rectangle shaped sub-surfaces termed as RIS tiles that can be sparsely deployed. An approximated ergodic spectral efficiency of the SAoS aided system is derived and the performance impact of the SAoS design is evaluated. Based on the approximated ergodic spectral efficiency, we obtain an optimal reflection coefficient design for each RIS tile. Analytical results show that the received signal-to-noise ratios can grow quadratically and linearly to the number of RIS elements under strong and weak LoS scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the visible region (VR) phenomenon in the SAoS aided mmWave system and find that the optimal distance between RIS tiles is supposed to yield a total SAoS VR nearly covering the whole blind coverage area. The numerical results verify the tightness of the approximated ergodic spectral efficiency and demonstrate the great system performance.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322466","Research and Development; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322466","Sparse array;reconfigurable intelligent surface;anti-blockage;mmWave","Millimeter wave communication;Linear antenna arrays;Buildings;Attenuation;Uplink;Transmission line matrix methods;Sparse matrices","array signal processing;electromagnetic wave reflection;intelligent materials;millimetre wave communication;radio spectrum management","approximated ergodic spectral efficiency;optimal reflection coefficient design;RIS tile;SAoS VR;reconfigurable intelligent surfaces;millimeter wave communication systems;SAoS design;antiblockage mmWave communication systems;sparse array of subsurface architecture;rectangle shaped subsurfaces;visible region phenomenon;received signal-to-noise ratios","","1","","14","IEEE","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal is the acquisition of soft-skills (e.g. negotiation, leadership, and identification of weak signals) and complex competences which are needed in emerging fields such as Sustainable Global Manufacturing. Sustainability combines environmental, economic, and social dimensions and is considered to be a complex and hard to learn subject needing a lot of experience to create competence. Therefore, the construction of a serious game to support the generation of such competences is not trivial and must be founded on a sound requirements analysis. The aim of this paper is to present relevant findings from the requirements analysis phase for developing a serious game scenario for a technology-enhanced learning platform called TARGET. The target audience is composed of master grade students of business administration and young professionals employed in medium level management positions. The methodology for requirements elicitation is based on the Volere template combined with subject matter experts' interviews.","","978-3-943024-05-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6041237","Sustainable Global Manufacturing;Serious Gaming;Requirements Analysis;Competences;Volere Template","Games;Green products;Interviews;Ice;Companies;Europe","learning (artificial intelligence);manufacturing industries;sustainable development;systems analysis","soft skills;serious game requirements analysis;technology enhanced learning;business administration;medium level management;sustainable global manufacturing;Volere template","","1","","6","","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Parallel coordinates can help decision-makers identify the most preferred solution among a number of alternatives. Multi-component systems require one such multi-attribute choice for each component. Each of these choices might have side effects on the system's operability and performance, making them co-dependent. Common approaches employ complex multi-component models or involve back-and-forth iterations between single components until an acceptable compromise is reached. A simultaneous visual exploration across independently modeled but connected components is needed to make system design more efficient. Using dedicated layout and interaction strategies, our Composite Parallel Coordinates allow analysts to explore both individual properties of components as well as their interoperability and joint performance. We showcase the effectiveness of Composite Parallel Coordinates for co-dependent multi-attribute choices by means of three real-world scenarios from distinct application areas.

All cloud vendors are not the same in terms of the number of services, infrastructure availability, security strategies, cost per customer, and reputation in the market. Thus, software developers and organizations face a dilemma when choosing a suitable cloud vendor for their developmental activities. Thus, there is a need to evaluate various cloud service providers (CSPs) and platforms before choosing a suitable vendor. Already existing solutions are either based on simulation tools as per the requirements or evaluated concerning the quality of service attributes. However, they require more time to collect data, simulate and evaluate the vendor. The proposed work compares various CSPs in terms of major metrics, such as establishment, services, infrastructure, tools, pricing models, market share, etc., based on the comparison, parameter ranking, and weightage allocated. Furthermore, the parameters are categorized depending on the priority level. The weighted average is calculated for each CSP, after which the values are sorted in descending order. The experimental results show the unbiased selection of CSPs based on the chosen parameters. The proposed parameter-ranking priority level weightage (PRPLW) algorithm simplifies the selection of the best-suited cloud vendor in accordance with the requirements of software development.","2096-0654","","10.26599/BDMA.2022.9020016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026515","cloud-based software development life cycle (SDLC);cloud evaluation;parameter-ranking priority level weightage (PRPLW) algorithm;cloud service providers;software engineering","Measurement;Software algorithms;Globalization;Quality of service;Pricing;Organizations;Software","cloud computing;software development management","cloud service provider evaluation;cloud-based software development lifecycle;CSP;global market;metric analysis;parameter-ranking priority level weightage algorithm;software developers","","","","16","","26 Jan 2023","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Furthermore, efficiencies realized in a specific platform may be lost if the application is migrated to a different platform. In this paper, we introduce and investigate the common scene definition framework (CSDF), a modeling representation consisting of a superset of capabilities taken from a collection of existing VR platforms. The purpose of CSDF is to serve a quick prototype framework for synthesizing an interactive virtual environment for a particular platform while attempting to optimize the translation to leverage strengths of the target platform. In an implementation independent fashion, the CSDF is envisioned to extensibly represent all geometry, appearance, interaction, and behavior for a VR application. Finally, an example is provided for demonstration of these basic ideas among the VRML 1.0, VRML97 and Java3D platforms.","1558-4305","0-7803-9519-0","10.1109/WSC.2005.1574477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1574477","","Layout;Virtual reality;Application software;Virtual prototyping;Virtual environment;Geometry;Java;Computer networks;Bandwidth;Computer industry","virtual reality","common scene definition framework;virtual world construction;VR platform application;modeling representation;interactive virtual environment","","","","8","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The application of VR technology in the defence paradigm is to make trainees and officers better at using equipment, navigating a mode of transport, gaining experience of potential combat situations, medical training and more. One of the advantages of VR training in defence is that it offers the functionality to immerse users in a virtual yet safe world.Our immersive system provides an intuitive way for the users to interact with the VR or AR world by physically moving around the real world and aiming freely with tangible objects. This encourages physical interaction between the players as they compete or collaborate with other players. We present a new immersive multiplayer simulation game developed for defence training.

This allows operators to assign tasks to UAVs, while safe operations are ensured through in-flight conflict detection and prevention. Our interface fulfills both functional (e.g., reliability) and non-functional requirements (e.g., perceived cognitive load during use). A key design challenge is the latency in information exchanges, which introduces information asymmetries between the humans and UAVs. We then validate the effectiveness of our interface design across several experiments. We find that our design reduces the perceived cognitive load and improves task performance.

"IEEE Draft Standard for Functional Safety Data Format for Interoperability within the Dependability Lifecycle","",,"IEEE P2851/D1.0, March 2023","5 Apr 2023","2023","","","1","243","The development of dependable systems is rapidly growing due to the expansion of new applications such as automated driving or autonomous mobile robotics. Standards such as ISO 26262 (automotive https://www.iso.org/standard/68383.html), IEC 61508 (https://www.iec.ch/functionalsafety/), and many others define the complete set of activities that need to be performed, requiring companies at different levels of the supply chain to tailor the lifecycle activities that apply to them and deliver results to other levels of the chain for which other requirements are applicable. However, currently, there are no common methods, languages, or formats to exchange the relevant data. As a result of this gap, companies are struggling with many different types of methods and description languages and are investing valuable time and effort to reconsolidate, compare, integrate, and combine the data. For this reason, the safety critical community is urgently asking for a solution to accelerate the safety engineering process while reducing risks and costs. The IEEE P2851 standardization initiative was started to define a dependability lifecycle as well as methods and formats for exchange/interoperability of data across all steps of the lifecycle in a consistent way. Additionally, the work products of this standardization initiative are expected to help enable interoperability between tools. The goal of this work is to provide structures and directions to allow a seamless exchange of information and interoperability between activities at the same or different level of abstraction, as well as activities across lifecycles related to different dependability attributes across application domains such as automotive, industrial, medical and avionics safety critical systems.","","978-1-5044-9611-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10093822","dependability;functional safety;interoperability","IEEE Standards;Safety;Interoperability","","","","","","","","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

The application of augmented reality (AR) can provide interactive systems in which real objects and computer data are combined in a cohesive way. This new paradigm has many potential applications in various fields, in particular in the maintenance domain. It allows the user to see computer generated virtual objects superimposed to the real world through the see-through head mounted display (HMD). The technician of maintenance, when using this system, can interact with the virtual world and have additional information, such as instruction for performing maintenance tasks in form of text messages, images, 3-D models of pieces or audio such as speech instruction. In this paper, we propose a design process of the maintenance system focused on the analysis of the interaction between the user, the system and the real world. This area is based on the UML notation. The use of UML represents our ergonomic and software design process basis for AR systems. This process also is based on ergonomic characteristics study within a UML system description and on the hybrid PAC-Amodeus model architecture adaptation for the AR systems.","","1-4244-0725-7","10.1109/ICIT.2006.372623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4237945","","Augmented reality;Unified modeling language;Application software;Computer displays;Ergonomics;Interactive systems;Head;Auditory displays;Speech;Process design","augmented reality;human computer interaction;maintenance engineering;Unified Modeling Language","maintenance;augmented reality;interactive systems;computer generated virtual objects;head mounted display;UML notation;PAC-Amodeus model architecture;software design process;ergonomic","","","","18","IEEE","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the growing literature volume makes it challenging for SR reviewers and clinicians to discover useful information efficiently. Many human-in-the-loop information retrieval approaches (HIR) have been proposed to rank documents semantically similar to users' queries and provide interactive visualizations to facilitate document retrieval. Given that the queries are mainly composed of keywords and keyphrases retrieving documents that are semantically similar to a query does not necessarily respond to the clinician's need. Clinicians still have to review many documents to find the solution. The problem motivates us to develop a visual analytics system, DocFlow, to facilitate information-seeking. One of the features of our DocFlow is accepting natural language questions. The detailed description enables retrieving documents that can answer users' questions. Additionally, clinicians often categorize documents based on their backgrounds and with different purposes (e.g., populations, treatments). Since the criteria are unknown and cannot be pre-defined in advance, existing methods can only achieve categorization by considering the entire information in documents. In contrast, by locating answers in each document, our DocFlow can intelligently categorize documents based on users' questions. The second feature of our DocFlow is a flexible interface where users can arrange a sequence of questions to customize their rules for document retrieval and categorization. The two features of this visual analytics system support a flexible information-seeking process. The case studies and the feedback from domain experts demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our DocFlow.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3219762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9939115","Biomedical systematic review;evidence-based-practice;human-in-the-loop information retrieval;question-based document retrieval;question-based document categorization","Systematics;Visual analytics;Task analysis;Semantics;Human in the loop;Natural languages;Bit error rate","","","","","","","IEEE","4 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As ER seems to be gaining popularity for its effectiveness as a learning tool, more research needs to be done in this area. Recent results from ER pilot projects advocate for the integration of ER in K-12 education curricula. On the other hand, teachers may face various difficulties in carrying out such activities due to lack of experience or knowledge in this field. Previous research has shown that ER is still an open field for exploration. Even though an increasing number of experiences are available for the use of robotic tools in early education, there is not enough empirical evidence on the features they need to present for young learners to perceive them as attractive and easy to use. In addition, the high cost of some tools may prevent educational institutions from using them systematically. To detect possible gaps in the current research, in the context of this work, 21 articles that have been published between 2011-2021 and represent ER applications and frameworks were collected and reviewed. The results of this study demonstrate that ER can be a valuable tool for supporting primary and pre-school students. However, the review supports that more research is needed on the technical features that a robotic tool must have to be successfully introduced to students of this age. Moreover, future work is needed to develop low-cost educational robotic tools so they can become more accessible to educational institutions.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2023.3266631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10100903","Educational Robotics;K-12;Robotics applications and frameworks;STEM","Education;Robots;Erbium;Databases;Bibliographies;Aging;STEM","","","","","","","CCBYNCND","12 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this work, we leverage the benefits of immersive head-mounted displays (HMDs) and present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a collaborative VR application for tactical resource planning on spatial data. We derived system and design requirements from consultations with domain experts and observations of a military on-site staff exercise, a simulation-based training aiming to strengthen rapid decision-making and teamwork during a time of crisis. To evaluate our prototype, we conducted semi-structured interviews with domain experts who organized and observed field tests at different military staff exercises. The interviews support the proposed design of the prototype and show general design implications for planning tools in VR.

It is extremely difficult to design a one-fits-all chip for all TSN applications. Therefore, application-driven TSN chip customization is inevitable. Generally, chip customization starts from a “clean-slate”. For complicated ASIC chips, that results in significant development overhead. Inspired by RISC-V chips, an open-source template will significantly reduce the customization complexity. Along this road, we propose an open-source TSN chip named Fenglin-I. Fenglin-I includes a high-level abstraction to build a relationship between application requirements and chip implementation, source code of a real chip named FastTSN to provide reference code for chip implementation, and software tools to facilitate chip verification. Based on Fenglin-I, we further propose a TSN chip customization method that provides step-by-step guidance about customizing TSN chips agilely. To verify the effectiveness of Fenglin-I and the proposed customization method, we use FPGA arrays to prototype and verify FastTSN. The results show that FastTSN achieves microsecond-level transmission jitter for unicast and multicast time-critical traffic. Additionally, we demonstrate two domain-specific TSN chip customization cases in which the customized chips reuse at least 84$\%$% of FastTSN code while meeting their requirements.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2022.3188179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9813546","Time-sensitive networking;chip customization;open-source chip;fenglin-I;FastTSN","Open source software;Codes;Jitter;Standards;Ethernet;Software tools;Logic gates","application specific integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit design;logic design;reduced instruction set computing","application-driven TSN chip customization;chip implementation;chip verification;complicated ASIC chips;complicated standard system;customization complexity;diverse application requirements;domain-specific TSN chip customization;Fenglin-I;FPGA arrays;microsecond-level transmission jitter;multicast time-critical traffic;open-source template;open-source time-sensitive networking chip;open-source TSN chip;RISC-V chips;software tools;source code;time-sensitive networking technology;TSN applications;TSN chip customization method;unicast time-critical traffic","","","","34","CCBY","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the combination of the latest data technologies and machine learning algorithms, DT-SA transfers those stubborn SA challenges to digital space, and then addresses them by building a domain-specific and data-friendly digital twin (DT) model upon massive data. The established model can be quantitatively tested via iterative virtual–real interaction and, thus, be evaluated and updated through closed-loop feedback to improve its performance in the physical world. To this end, some engineering and scientific problems are raised: 1) virtual–real interaction mechanism relevant to resource flow and data flow; 2) unified modeling and analysis of heterogeneous spatial–temporal data; 3) DT configuration and evolution; and 4) domain-specific DT-SA characterization. To solve these problems, cloud-edge-terminal configuration, big data analytics (BDA), DT, and SA indicator systems are studied, respectively. Then, the random matrix theory (RMT) and overarching DT-SA framework are designed as a roadmap.

"HEDF: A Method for Early Forecasting Software Defects Based on Human Error Mechanisms","F. Huang; L.

Little research has been done to forecast defects on the basis of the cognitive errors that cause them. The existing “defect prediction” models are applied to code once it has been produced: therefore, their “predictions” have little implications for preventing the defects. This paper proposes an approach, “Human-Error-based Defect Forecast” (HEDF), to forecasting the exact defects at early stages of software development, before the code is produced, through knowledge about the cognitive mechanisms that cause developers’ errors. This approach is based on a model of human error mechanisms underlying software defects: a defect is caused by an error-prone scenario triggering human error modes, which psychologists have observed to recur across diverse activities. Software defects can then be forecast by identifying such error-prone scenarios the in requirements and/or design documents. We assessed this approach empirically, with 55 programmers in a programming competition and four representative analysts serving as the users of the approach. Impressively, the approach was able to forecast, at the requirement phase, 75.7% of the defects later committed by all of the programmers. When considering just the defect forms, which may manifest as distinct defects even in the same program, the proposed method predicted 31.8% of them. This approach substantially improved the defect forecasting performances for analysts of various expertise, with a minimum of 100% improvement, compared to forecasts without the approach. If the forecast had been used to prevent the defects, it could have saved an estimated 46.2% of the debugging effort and increased the fraction of programmers delivering an acceptable program by 32.6%. The observed excellent performance of HEDF in forecasting (early at requirement stage) the exact forms and locations of defects that may be later introduced by developers into code makes it a promising candidate for preventing the defects, worthy of further study.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3234490","Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), I.P./MCTES through National Funds (PIDDAC), within the Scope of CISUC Research and Development Unit(grant numbers:UIDB/00326/2020,UIDP/00326/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10006782","Defect forecast;defect prevention;human error;programming cognition;software quality assurance","Software quality;Measurement;Codes;Predictive models;Forecasting;Programming;Quality assurance;Software testing;Error analysis;Human factors","error analysis;man-machine systems;program debugging;program testing;software metrics;software quality","cognitive errors;defect prediction models;distinct defects;early forecasting software defects;error-prone scenario;HEDF;human error mechanisms;human-error-based defect forecast;software development","","","","77","CCBYNCND","5 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They then rely on multiple traditional techniques (inheritance, patterns) to realize variability, making these implementations not explicit. This directly hampers the comprehension of variability implementations, especially for newcomers in a project that need, in a short time, to understand the most important parts. In this paper, we propose VariCity, a visualization using the city metaphor to exhibit zones of interest, being zones of high density of variability implementations. The different forms of variability implementations are first detected through the usage of symmetries in code (e.g., inheritance defines a substitution symmetry between the immutable part of the superclass and the possible changes in its subclasses). VariCity then creates a 3D city representation with buildings being classes while the metrics on the number of symmetries (e.g., the number of overloaded methods, influence the building size, and their color if they are heavily loaded in symmetries). Contrary to the usual package-based organization in code-related city representations, the city streets are arranged according to the usage relationships between classes. Inheritance is simply represented with hoverable aerial links. Variability-related design patterns are depicted as buildings with specific geometric forms, while some classes specified as entry points can help in shaping the whole city organization. We also report on the evaluation of VariCity on a set of large object-oriented systems, showing that several usage scenarios helping a newcomer to spot critical variability-related zones are covered.","","978-1-6654-3144-6","10.1109/VISSOFT52517.2021.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604906","variability;software visualization;software cities","Measurement;Couplings;Visualization;Codes;Three-dimensional displays;Software metrics;Urban areas","data visualisation;object-oriented methods;object-oriented programming;software metrics","object-oriented variability implementations;single code base;VariCity;city metaphor;3D city representation;code-related city representations;variability-related design patterns;object-oriented systems;software systems;visualization;hoverable aerial links;geometric forms","","","","77","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The visualization community has created many visualization collections, and developed interactive exploration systems for the collections. However, the systems are mainly based on extrinsic attributes like authors and publication years, whilst neglect intrinsic property (i.e., visual appearance) of visualizations, hindering visual comparison and query of visualization designs. This paper presents VISAtlas, an image-based approach empowered by neural image embedding, to facilitate exploration and query for visualization collections. To improve embedding accuracy, we create a comprehensive collection of synthetic and real-world visualizations, and use it to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a triplet loss for taxonomical classification of visualizations. Next, we design a coordinated multiple view (CMV) system that enables multi-perspective exploration and design retrieval based on visualization embeddings. Specifically, we design a novel embedding overview that leverages contextual layout framework to preserve the context of the embedding vectors with the associated visualization taxonomies, and density plot and sampling techniques to address the overdrawing problem. We demonstrate in three case studies and one user study the effectiveness of VISAtlas in supporting comparative analysis of visualization collections, exploration of composite visualizations, and image-based retrieval of visualization designs. The studies reveal that real-world visualization collections (e.g., Beagle and VIS30K) better accord with the richness and diversity of visualization designs than synthetic collections (e.g., Data2Vis), inspiring composite visualizations are identified in real-world collections, and distinct design patterns exist in visualizations from different sources.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3229023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9984953","Visualization collection;image embedding;visual query;image visualization;design pattern","Data visualization;Visualization;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Layout;Taxonomy;Semantics","","","","","","","IEEE","14 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Using agglomerative hierarchical clustering, we represent the referenced locations of news articles on a globe with different levels of detail. We employ two interaction schemes for navigating the viewpoint on the visualization, including support for hand-held devices and desktop PCs, and provide search functionality and interactive filtering. Based on this framework, we explore additional modules for jointly exploring the spatial and temporal domain of the dataset and incorporating live news into the visualization.","1558-1756","","10.1109/MCG.2021.3127434","Ringier; TX Group; NZZ; SRG; VSM; viscom; ETH Zürich Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9612019","","Visualization;Online services;Graphical models;Distribution functions;Histograms;Publishing","data visualisation;electronic publishing;information retrieval;Internet;pattern clustering;portals;text analysis","navigation;recent ones;spatial context;support readers;multiple online news portals;agglomerative hierarchical clustering;interaction schemes;interactive filtering;incorporating live news;news globe;geolocalized news articles;online news articles;exploring articles","","","","20","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Successful reuse of existing components requires being able to first identify, and then distinguish among, functionally (near-) equivalent elements of large component collections. Similar components can be ranked using quality criteria, thus, some goal-oriented techniques attempt to quantify components quality by indicating valid ranges for their properties and behavior, like stability, latency and so on. Unfortunately, most current techniques yield non-robust ranges, and most tools do not allow architects to observe the range selection during the process. This paper presents a technique for sensitivity analysis of components discovery, built over fuzzy sets. A prototypical tool has been built, and use of the technique and tool are illustrated with an example. This iterative approach allows evaluators to compare ""what if"" scenarios for alternative component quality criteria, supporting requirements evolution without continuous expert support to recalibrate valid property ranges.","","978-0-7695-4626-1","10.1109/SBCARS.2011.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6114539","discovery;fuzzy sets;sensitive analysis","Fuzzy sets;Web services;Proposals;Measurement;Pragmatics;Shape","fuzzy set theory;iterative methods;object-oriented programming;sensitivity analysis;software quality","component discovery process;automatic sensitive analysis;complex software systems;goal-oriented techniques;sensitivity analysis;fuzzy sets;iterative approach;component quality criteria","","","","18","IEEE","29 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Enceladus is a promising hot spot for astrobiology in the solar system. A concept studied at the Institute for Space Technology and Space Applications (ISTA) of Bundeswehr University Munich in the context of the DLR funded Enceladus Explorer project (EnEx) aimed to place a lander near one of the plume sources on the bottom of a tiger stripe canyon on the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus. A spacecraft landing near one of the plume sources and deploying a melting probe to sample relatively shallow liquid water in the ice under that plume source would be able to look for signatures of life before they are degraded by exposure to the vacuum of space. The lander would have to meet very challenging landing accuracy and reliability requirements on an exceptionally challenging terrain. To perform this challenging landing, a sophisticated landing Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C) system would be necessary. For the lander to land within the narrow canyon floor with the required accuracy, a terrain relative navigation (TRN) function can use sensors such as optical and thermal cameras, LIDAR, etc. to navigate relative to detected terrain features. To ensure a safe landing in the hazardous terrain, a hazard detection and avoidance (HDA) function must be able to assess if the originally planned landing site is safe, and if not to then autonomously command a retargeting to another safer spot. The guidance function must then calculate a viable trajectory and thrust arc to the newly chosen landing site. To validate that the landing satisfies the accuracy and reliability requirements we are developing a tool in Matlab to simulate the operation of the autonomous landing GN&C system. In this paper we describe the tool and we present its development status. We then demonstrate that the accuracy and safety requirements are met for landing on an adequately realistic tiger stripe canyon-like simulated terrain. Based on the simulation results we also propose possible modifications to the landing GN&C system.","","978-1-5386-2014-4","10.1109/AERO.2018.8396476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396476","","Space technology;Saturn;Probes;Ice;Navigation;Tools;Moon","aircraft landing guidance;entry, descent and landing (spacecraft);planetary satellites;planetary surfaces;Saturn;space vehicles","terrain relative navigation function;safe landing;originally planned landing site;newly chosen landing site;autonomous landing GN&C system;development status;adequately realistic tiger stripe canyon-like simulated terrain;simulation results;plume source;simulation tool;planetary landing operations;South Polar Terrain;landing simulation;Enceladus Explorer project;spacecraft landing;exceptionally challenging terrain;Saturn moon Enceladus;relatively shallow liquid water;hazard detection and avoidance function;HDA function;landing accuracy requirements;landing reliability requirements;sophisticated landing GN&C system","","","","48","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reassembling the fragments of a broken object to restore its original state is the prerequisite of many analytical tasks such as cultural relics analysis and forensics reasoning. While existing computer-aided methods can automatically reassemble fragments, they often derive incorrect objects due to the complex and ambiguous fragment shapes. Thus, experts usually need to refine the object manually. Prior advances in immersive technologies provide benefits for realistic perception and direct interactions to visualize and interact with 3D fragments. However, few studies have investigated the reassembled object refinement. The specific challenges include: 1) the fragment combination set is too large to determine the correct matches, and 2) the geometry of the fragments is too complex to align them properly. To tackle the first challenge, PuzzleFixer leverages dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques, allowing users to review possible match categories, select the matches with reasonable shapes, and drill down to shapes to correct the corresponding faces. For the second challenge, PuzzleFixer embeds the object with node-link networks to augment the perception of match relations. Specifically, it instantly visualizes matches with graph edges and provides force feedback to facilitate the efficiency of alignment interactions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PuzzleFixer, we conducted an expert evaluation based on two cases on real-world artifacts and collected feedback through post-study interviews. The results suggest that our system is suitable and efficient for experts to refine incorrect reassembled objects.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209388","NSFC(grant numbers:62072400); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFC1521102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906965","Immersive visualization;interactive exploration;fragment reassembly;cultural heritage","Three-dimensional displays;Visualization;Shape;Manuals;Faces;Optimization;Cultural differences","archaeology;computational geometry;data visualisation;feature extraction;force feedback;graph theory;image matching;image reconstruction;inference mechanisms;interactive systems;pattern clustering;solid modelling","alignment interactions;ambiguous fragment shapes;analytical tasks;broken object;clustering techniques;complex fragment shapes;computer-aided methods;correct matches;cultural relics analysis;direct interactions;expert evaluation;forensics reasoning;fragment combination set;immersive fragments restoration;immersive interactive system;immersive technologies;incorrect objects;incorrect reassembled objects;match relations;possible match categories;PuzzleFixer leverages dimensionality reduction;realistic perception;reasonable shapes;reassembled object refinement;specific challenges include;visual reassembly system","","","","73","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, each dataset is described by different metadata, stored in various structures and formats. This research can be counted among those whose aim is to provide a structural and semantic pattern for affective computing datasets, which is an important step to solve the problem of data reuse and integration in this domain. In our previous work, the ROAD ontology was introduced. This ontology was designed as a skeleton for expressing contextual data describing time series obtained in various ways from various signals and was focused on common contextual data, independent of specific signals. The aim of the presented research is to provide a carefully curated vocabulary for describing signals obtained from electrodermal activity, a very important subdomain of emotion analysis. We decided to present it as an extension to the ROAD ontology in order to offer means of sharing metadata for datasets in a unified and precise way. To meet this aim, the research methodology was defined, mostly focusing on requirements specification and integration with other existing ontologies. Application of this methodology resulted firstly in sharing the requirements to allow a broader discussion and secondly development of the EDA extension of the ROAD ontology, validated against the MAHNOB-HCI dataset. Both these results are very important with respect to the vast context of the work, i.e. providing an extendable framework for describing affective computing experiments. Introducing the methodology also opens the way for providing new extensions systematically just by executing the steps defined in the methodology.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3257573","Gdańsk University of Technology under the Technetium Talent Management Grants - “Excellence Initiative-Research University”(grant numbers:DEC-2/2022/IDUB/III.4.1/Tc); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10070753","Affective computing;dataset;emotion;ontology;time series;ontology development;conceptualization;signal;EDA;electrodermal activity","Ontologies;Road traffic;Emotion recognition;Affective computing;Data collection;Object recognition;Metadata;Affective computing","","","","","","75","CCBYNCND","15 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of them is a platform for children. In the context of children, it requires different treatment. So far, it found many articles discussing this issue. Usability is an indicator to measure a friendly platform. This article aims to capture the problems regarding usability and children by providing a literature review (meta-analysis). Some articles are observed on IEEE and ACM digital libraries published in the period 2011 to 2020. 80 articles are collected. Various aspects are found, such as approaches, methods, tools, design principles, and indicators.

We leverage the Robot Operating System (ROS), an open source set of tools and libraries not only for its communication middleware to broadcast this data over its network stack but also because it allows us to interface and obtain relevant data from other depth-sensing devices that ROS can already interface via its community-driven open source packages.

Among these methods, phrase-based retrieval methods have been proven to capture more concrete and concise information than word-based and paragraph-based methods. However, due to the complex relationship among phrases and a lack of proper visual guidance, achieving user-driven interactive information-seeking and retrieval remains challenging. In this study, we present a visual analytic approach for users to seek information from an extensive collection of documents efficiently. The main component of our approach is a PhraseMap, where nodes and edges represent the extracted keyphrases and their relationships, respectively, from a large corpus. To build the PhraseMap, we extract keyphrases from each document and link the phrases according to word attention determined using modern language models, i.e., BERT. As can be imagined, the graph is complex due to the extensive volume of information and the massive amount of relationships. Therefore, we develop a navigation algorithm to facilitate information seeking. It includes (1) a question-answering (QA) model to identify phrases related to users' queries and (2) updating relevant phrases based on users' feedback. To better present the PhraseMap, we introduce a resource-controlled self-organizing map (RC-SOM) to evenly and regularly display phrases on grid cells while expecting phrases with similar semantics to stay close in the visualization. To evaluate our approach, we conducted case studies with three domain experts in diverse literature. The results and feedback demonstrate its effectiveness, usability, and intelligence.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3225114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9964397","Machine learning;natural language processing;textual data;user-in-the-loop;visual analytics","Data visualization;Navigation;Bit error rate;Semantics;Computational modeling;Visual analytics;Task analysis","","","","","","","IEEE","28 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, these technologies present three main drawbacks: (1) a high cost in terms of hardware and infrastructure, (2) a high level of technology knowledge, and usually programming skills, is required to build up an educational and functional platform, and (3) once the educational platform is available for use, the educators are limited to the functionalities provided by the platform used. Our previous experience, designing and deploying a VR educational platform, named V-LeaF, showed that non immersive platforms (close to the gaming 3D platforms) provide High School educators and students with an attractive environment in which many features of the teaching/learning experience can be explored. However, this technological strength appears as a potential weakness feature of our platform when is used by high school students. Serious problems to maintain the student attention in this kind of domains have been detected, so the educators must employ time and dedication to ensure that students are really attending and acquiring the educational concepts scheduled.

Thus, the high level of interest and utility of drones and the crescent demand of service-oriented platforms surged up to be a great fusion of concepts. Nowadays, training and competition requires users to have their own aircraft(s) and to move, usually, to an arena where they can play with each other. Having it in consideration, in this work it's proposed a platform that combines real-time online gaming and drones' training and competition, in which users from around the world can socialize and play together. This paper runs through an overview of the concept, presenting the specifications and the requirements that the platform must meet to accomplish the desired objective. The proposed platform provides access to anyone, anytime, anywhere and with any device. It opens the possibility for users to communicate with each other and to control aircrafts with real-time video transmission, only achievable due to the distributed architecture designed, that minimizes the existence of single points of failure.","","978-1-5386-8455-9","10.1109/TISHW.2018.8559555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8559555","competition;drones;platform;real-time online gaming;sports;unmanned aerial vehicles","","computer games;distributed processing;mobile robots;remotely operated vehicles","online gaming;real-time video transmission;drones competition;service oriented platform;smartphone","","","","14","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a set of novel techniques to overcome these limitations. Based on the light field rendering concept, we utilize an array of cameras to capture the participant(s) from multiple view angles. Based on either assumed or estimated scene geometry, these images are assembled to create a high-resolution seamless image from a user-controllable viewpoint. Two different camera configurations, one dense and one sparse, are presented; the dense format is optimized for high-fidelity view synthesis while the sparse configuration is for expanded viewing volume. For the dense configuration, we provide a detailed analysis on the number of camera images required. For the sparse configuration, we present a robust technique to estimate an approximation of the scene geometry to provide smooth transition when the viewpoint is changed. The novelty of our approach is that it allows the users to electronically steer the viewpoint in real time for a live scene. Therefore it can be used in 3D teleconferencing systems to generate stereoscopic views, or in group teleconferencing to provide virtual camera views that minimize the overall perspective distortions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a point-to-point teleconferencing system distributed in several locations across the continental United States.","1054-7460","","10.1162/pres.16.2.188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797565","","","","","","","","","","19 May 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Cancer is one of the diseases responsible for mortality in the world today and especially breast cancer in women have increased in alarming numbers. This paper gives an insight into a new device and technology which can be used to remove cancer in a minimally invasively surgical procedure. It consists of a robotic surgical machine integrated with a breast scanner and a therapeutic ultrasound frequency to perform this procedure. The idea is to integrate the scanning and therapeutic modality into one unit. PRIMA is a conglomeration of the scanning equipment, a high intensity focussed ultrasound therapy equipment and robotic surgery equipment. It has a portable scanner which scans and detects the presence of a tumour. The detected tumour is analysed and processed using the mechatronics and image processing enabled equipment. The target is fixed and highintensity ultrasound is used to ablate the tumour cells. In this manner, instead of using three different devices, we propose to integrate all of them as a single user-friendly device.","2155-2509","978-1-5386-7902-9","10.1109/COMSNETS.2019.8711373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8711373","robotic surgery;breast cancer;high intensity focussed ultrasound therapy (HIFU);tumour ablation","Tumors;Ultrasonic imaging;Surgery;Robots;Breast cancer","biological organs;biomedical equipment;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;diseases;medical robotics;radiation therapy;surgery;tumours","alarming numbers;minimally invasively surgical procedure;robotic surgical machine;breast scanner;therapeutic ultrasound frequency;ultrasound therapy equipment;robotic surgery equipment;portable scanner;PRIMA-A device;minimally invasive breast cancer surgery;medical devices","","","","12","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
