abstract = {The concept of twinning an operational physical system with a functional replica is not new, having been practiced in the space sector for over 50 years. Advances in digitalisation have created opportunities to extract data, obtain insights and achieve greater situational awareness of a physical system’s performance. Increasing interest in the concept has led to a proliferation of digital twin definitions, which are used to frame discussions about specific digital twins. Consequentially comparison of the capabilities of specific digital twins is difficult as they are analysed using different definitions. This paper proposes an analysis framework that enables the characteristics of all digital twins to be matched to this framework. Using this framework, a digital twin may be characterised, or two or more digital twins may be compared. By establishing a framework that contains common functional characteristics, we aim to reduce the confusion caused by the plethora of digital twin definitions and their interpretation by suppliers. By focusing only on functionality and not addressing non-functional requirements the analysis allows comparison of different physical and logical instantiations of digital twins.}

Requirements specification is generally intended to provide clear, testable descriptions of what a system should do. What an ontology would do is to act like a requirements bank that provides methodology independent accessibility requirements that could then be used to extrapolate, on demand, conceptual models for a variety of implementations driven by a variety of methodologies. The effect of this would be to minimise requirements specification, ensure declarativity, standardisation, interoperability and reusability, whilst at the same time lending greater migratability from specification to design. There has been much worldwide action in developing guidelines, tools and methods in an attempt to ensure that technologies and information systems are accessible. There is, however, a growing need to partner these initiatives more closely with software engineering traditions. An ontology for accessibility requirements would provide formal semantic specifications beyond the syntactic provisions rendered by commonly used formal specification languages.}

We conducted a controlled trial with ten healthy children aged 7–14 to test the functional suitability and usability of the CogniDron-EEG system. Also, this study allowed us to evaluate the preference between our system and another system based on video games. Therefore, participant subjects used our CogniDron-EEG system and a system called Nexus to identify the users’ preferences concerning these two systems. The findings suggest that participants were satisfied with the CogniDron-EEG and provide the basis for further development and research on the CogniDron-EEG system.

abstract = {Smart product service system (PSS) has become an essential strategy to transform towards digital servitization for manufacturing companies. By leveraging smart capabilities, smart PSS aims to create superior user experience in a smart context. To develop a successful smart PSS, customer requirement management from smart experience perspective is necessary. However, it is a challenging task to identify and evaluate diverse, implicit and interrelated smart experience-oriented customer requirement (SEO-CR) in smart PSS context. Hence, this paper proposes an effective methodology to elicit and analyze SEO-CRs. At first, a generic, two-dimensional SEO-CR system is presented as a basis to derive the tailored SEO-CRs for various smart PSS applications. Second, a novel HFLC-DEMATEL (hesitant fuzzy linguistic cloud-based Decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory) method is proposed to accurately evaluate the priority and complicated interaction of SEO-CRs, considering the hesitancy, fuzziness and randomness under uncertain decision environment. Some new operations (e.g., cloud total-relation matrix and weight determination method) and a cloud influence relation map are developed to fully take advantage of cloud model in DEMATEL implementation. Finally, a real case of smart vehicle service system (SVSS) is presented. The 18 SEO-CRs of the SVSS are derived based on the generalized SEO-CRs. By using HFLC-DEMATEL, some important SEO-CRs in context of SVSS are identified, such as autonomous and convenience. The finding of results can help designers make proper decisions in design and development of SVSS with a superior smart experience. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are validated by conducting some comparative analyses.}

abstract = {Although companies systematically strive for a full digitalisation of their products and their processes, the design phase shows that the quality of models is very unequal. Indeed, detailed design benefits from much more sophisticated methods and tools than the specification and architecture activities. Although, we should note the recent paradigm shift from document-based to model-based systems engineering, these models, which are mainly static 2D diagrams, remain poor to facilitate design verification early on. Thus, to detect most errors during the design phase, companies have no other alternative than to wait up to the testing phase which occurs after several years of development for complex systems. Thus, we propose a user-centric computer-aided verification process to ensure that the design meets the requirements under realistic operational conditions. The verification process provides a progressive immersion into the virtual system before seamlessly transitioning to the real system. Our work is built upon state-of-the-art MBSE methods such as the Property Model Methodology, which enables systems engineers to co-simulate specification models and design models. We improve such MBSE methods by increasing the level of realism that experiences the end-user during the verification of a design by the original combination of Model-In-the-Loop, Immersive Model-In-the-Loop, Human-In-the-Loop, and Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation strategies. A robot arm is used as a use case to illustrate the verification process.}

In this paper, according to the geometric features reflected in the data points, a method for calculating the tangent vectors at the corresponding data points is proposed for reference. And based on the constraints on tangent vectors (calculated by the proposed reference method, can also be given beforehand) and control points, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms-II, namely NSGA-II, is adopted for adaptive B-spline curve interpolation without knowing nodes and knots in advance. The resulting interpolation curve approximates the given tangent vectors and the data polyline, and it is more natural-looking, in general than those obtained by other methods. In addition, the new method works well in a higher degree. Testing results on the feasibility and universal applicability of the new method are also included.}

The specification is written in the algebraic language ELICSIR and the prototype in the logic programming language Prolog. The prototype produced by transformation is formally correct with respect to the original specification. In addition, it is a high-level product that keeps a sufficient trace of the original specification; this allows the specification to be easily adjusted according to the user's comments about the prototype execution. The computer-aided prototyping approach is illustrated by showing the application of the successive transformation steps on the specification of a short and complete example.}

A longstanding technological challenge exists regarding the precise assembly design and performance optimization of large optics in high power laser facilities, comprising a combination of many complex problems involving mechanical, material, and laser beam physics.
Method
In this study, an augmented virtual assembly framework based on a multiphysics analysis and digital simulation is presented for the assembly optimization of large optics. This framework focuses on the fundamental impact of the structural and assembly parameters of a product on its optical performance; three-dimensional simulation technologies improve the accuracy and measurability of the impact. Intelligent iterative computation algorithms have been developed to optimize the assembly plan of large optics, which are significantly affected by a series of constraints including dynamic loads and nonlinear ambient excitations.
Results
Finally, using a 410-mm-aperture frequency converter as the study case, we present a detailed illustration and discussion to validate the performance of the proposed system in large optics assembly and installation engineering.}

Good maintainability design can save substantial costs and reduce incidents and accidents throughout the product life cycle. Therefore, maintainability should be given full consideration in the early design stages. However, the current desktop tools are not effective to aid in maintainability design. Virtual reality (VR), a state-of-the-art of computer science, generates a virtual environment in which the user can have intuitive feelings and interact with virtual objects. In this paper, an immersive maintainability verification and evaluation system (IMVES) based on virtual reality is proposed. The goal of the system is to develop a cost-effective, rapid and precise method to improve the maintainability design in the early design stages. IMVES enables the user to interact with maintenance objects and conduct immersive simulations. Based on the developed methods, the data generated during simulation can be gathered to analyze the maintainability status. A case study applying IMVES into an aero-engine project is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the system. Compared with desktop-based methods, the IMVES could provide a more efficient way to conduct a maintenance simulation. Furthermore, the credibility and objectivity of the maintainability evaluation are also improved.}

The participation of users in the design process is recognized as a positive and a necessary element as artifacts suit their needs. Two complementary approaches of users’ involvement co-exist: the user-centered design and the participatory design. These approaches involve learning process from users to designers and vice versa. However, there has no research in design of virtual reality (VR)-based software dealing with how the elaboration of needs is actually distributed in time and among users, designers and project leaders, as well as how it is actually supported by tools and methods.
Objective
This paper aims to observe, in a real design project of a virtual reality-based software, how the various stakeholders (users, designers, project leaders) actually participate by sharing and pulling pieces of information from the process of needs elaboration, and how these contributions evolve throughout the decisions made in the course of the project.
Method
Our method, based on the observation of the practices in collective design, allows us to collect and analyze the relationship between each possible action (e.g., elicitation), each stakeholder who initiates these actions (e.g., users) and each phase of the design process (e.g., evaluation phase), and the dynamics of the construction of needs.
Results
Our results detail how the elicited needs are dealt with by designers, users and/or project leaders: (1) we show a strong contribution of users in the design, compared to others stakeholders, (2) among the needs elicited by users, most have been validated by the designers, (3) some elicited needs could have been firstly rejected and finally validated and implemented.
Conclusion
We identify the reasons which justify and explain our results confronting them to the literature. We underline the conditions have been satisfied in our study in order to involve effectively users in the design of emerging technologies.}

In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering for students’ individual learning characteristics. To address this issue, learning styles become effective to understand students’ different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the students’ learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder–Silverman Learning Style Model in a Scrum course. Based on previous findings, we focused on the processing dimension of the model. To validate our approach, two experiments were conducted in an undergraduate software engineering course in the academic years 2013 and 2014. We provided students with a Scrum class by applying teaching strategies suiting students’ learning style.

abstract = {Context
Requirements elicitation is a crucial phase in the software development life cycle. During requirements elicitation sessions, requirements engineers capture software requirements, and motivate stakeholders to express needs and expected software functionalities. In this context, there is a lack of extensive empirical research reporting the extent to which elicitation sessions can be influenced by participants' gender.
Objective
This paper presents our research endeavour to investigate requirements engineers' effort and elicited requirements' accuracy based on participants' gender.
Method
We conducted an experiment in two rounds with a total of 59 students who played the role of requirements engineers. In the first experimental task, the participant watched two videos where men and women stakeholders expressed software requirements. Later on, the participants specified software requirements in the shape of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and next they generated Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) from those models.
Results
We observed two significant differences. One between men and women requirements engineers in terms of dedicated effort during requirements specification: men took less effort. Other between stakeholders' gender in terms of accuracy resulted of BPMN models: models built from men stakeholders yield more accuracy. On the contrary, accuracy of resulted GUIs models did not show significant differences regarding requirements engineers or stakeholders' gender.
Conclusions
Analysing descriptive data, women spent more time both as stakeholders and as requirements engineers but their accuracy is better.}

Hence, a core asset is a key element of PLE, and therefore the reusability of the core asset largely determines the success of PLE projects. However, current quality models to evaluate reusability do not adequately address the unique characteristics of core assets in PLE. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for evaluating the reusability of core assets. We first identify the key characteristics of core assets, and derive a set of quality attributes that characterizes the reusability of core assets. Then, we define metrics for each quality attribute and finally present practical guidelines for applying the evaluation framework in PLE projects. Using the proposed framework, the reusability of core assets can be more effectively and precisely evaluated.}

abstract = {As a novel computational approach, ubiquitous computing was emerging at the beginning of the 1980s and has reached a rather mature level by now. It assumes that computing can be available anywhere, anytime and in any context due to technological developments, social demands and calm implementations. Over the years, the opportunities of this computing paradigm have been explored and the benefits have been exploited successfully in many application fields. This survey paper addresses ubiquitous computing from the perspective of enabling computer aided design. The specific objectives of the reported survey are to: (i) give an overall account of the current status of ubiquitous computing and technologies, (ii) cast light on how ubiquitous computing has influenced the development of CAD systems, tools, and methods, and (iii) critically investigate future development opportunities of ubiquitous computing enabled computer aided design. First, the paper discusses the principles and typical technologies of ubiquitous computing. Then, the development and spectrum of the so-called standard computer aided design tasks are analyzed from a computational point of view. Afterwards, the already implemented design enabling functionalities are discussed and some additional functional possibilities are considered. The literature provides evidence that ubiquitous computing has not managed to revolutionize the methodologies or the systems of computer aided design so far, though many researchers intensively studied the affordances and the application possibilities of ubiquitous technologies. One reason is that ubiquitous computing technologies had in the last two decades to compete with other kinds of computational technologies, such as high-capacity computing, high-speed networking, immersive virtual reality, knowledge ontologies, smart software agents, mobile communication, etc., which had a much stronger influence on the development of computer aided design methods and systems. In combination with the rather conservative and conventionalist industrial practice of CAD system development and application, this may explain why the ubiquitous computing revolution remained weak in computer aided design. The literature clearly indicates that application of ubiquitous technologies did not lead to radically new functionalities that could have been exploited by the concerned industries. Consequently, it seems to be possible that computer aided design simply steps over the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and expects new functionalities from the emerging new computing paradigms, such as brain–computer interfacing, cyber–physical computing, biological computing, or quantum computing.}

The question that motivates this study is: ‘is it possible to train industrial workers for what exactly is coming instead of preparing them for a large set of scenarios - even very unlikely ones?’. This work proposes: (i) a structured On-the-Job Training strategy for non-routine tasks, called ‘training-on-the-go’ or ‘prescriptive training’, according to which a Prescriptive Analytics module schedules the training sessions not long before the actual performance, but only when and if needed; (ii) a proof-of-concept of a game-based training system where virtual scenes and context of an industrial site are faithfully recreated thanks to digital twin data and models; (iii) the use of evolutionary-based fuzzy cognitive maps (E-FCM) for the extraction of the workers’ implicit procedural knowledge and for the comparison of mental models of experienced vs. inexperienced workers to assess potential misconceptions or flaws in their decision-making process. This work contributes to the evolution of worker training paradigms and systems from the perspective of human-centric cyber-physical production systems and aims for current gaps in workforce training, i.e. poor timeliness and effectiveness, limited context and industrial information integration, and scarce focus on the experts’ implicit knowledge. An application study with a non-routine task on an offshore oil platform demonstrates how the proposed system facilitates knowledge transfer, offers situational awareness and sustains the workforce competence development process.}

The workings of medical educational tools are implemented using a myriad of approaches ranging from presenting static content to immersing students in gamified virtual-reality environments. The objective of this paper is to explore whether and how different approaches for designing medical educational tools affect students’ learning performance.
Materials and methods
Four versions of an educational tool for the study of clinical cases were implemented: a 2D version, a gamified 2D version, a gamified 3D version, and a gamified immersive-virtual-reality version. All complying with the same functional requirements. Each version was used and evaluated by an independent group of students. The participants (n = 78) evaluated the applications regarding usefulness, usability, and gamification. Afterward, the students took an exam to assess the retention of information on the clinical cases presented.
Results
One-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirmed that the participants perceived that it was at least quite likely that gamification helped improved their learning. In addition, based on the participants’ perception, the gamification of the immersive-virtual-reality version helped the most to improve their learning performance in comparison with the gamified 2D and 3D versions.
Conclusions
Regardless of whether different versions of a medical educational tool (complying with the same functional requirements) are perceived as equally useful and usable, the design approach (either 2D, 3D, or immersive-virtual-reality with or without gamification) affects students’ retention of information on clinical cases.}

In order to achieve the natural and efficient human–computer interaction, we analyze the interaction requirements of flow visualization and study the characteristics of four human–computer interaction channels: hand, head, eye and voice. We give out some multimodal interaction design suggestions and then propose three multimodal interaction methods: head & hand, head & hand & eye and head & hand & eye & voice. The freedom of gestures, the stability of the head, the convenience of eyes and the rapid retrieval of voices are used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of interaction. The interaction load is balanced by multimodal interaction to reduce fatigue. The evaluation shows that our multimodal interaction has higher accuracy, faster time efficiency and much lower fatigue than the traditional joystick interaction.}

Optimization of assembly and training of staff requires a series of demo installations and excessive use of costly operational resources. In some cases, components are located at different sites, making the orchestration of the whole system even more difficult. Virtual Reality (VR) collaboration environments offer a solution by enabling high fidelity testing and training of complex manufacturing systems. On the other hand, such platforms are difficult to implement in an engineering perspective, as they are required to provide reliable, standard interfaces towards both robotic components and human operators. The VirCA (Virtual Collaboration Arena) platform is a software framework that supports various means of collaboration through the use of 3D augmented/virtual reality as a communication medium. VirCA offers functions for the high-level interoperability of heterogeneous components in a wide range of domains, spanning from research & development, through remote education to orchestration and management of industrial processes in manufacturing applications. This paper provides an overview of the industrial requirements behind high-fidelity virtual collaboration and demonstrates how the VirCA platform meets these requirements.

Current definitions of mixed reality situations cannot cope adequately with this new class of experience. In this paper we name this new situation as “pervasive virtuality”, which we define as being a virtual environment that is extended by incorporating physical elements as proxy objects, integrating contextual information, and resolving conflicts with the dominance of a particular sense (usually vision). This new mixed reality paradigm is not well understood by both industry and academia. Therefore, we propose an extension to the well-known Milgram and Colquhoun’s taxonomy to cope with this new mixed reality situation. Furthermore, we propose Pervasive Virtuality characteristics that represent quality requirements, which help us to understand and design this new type of virtual environment. This paper also presents a brief case study using these characteristics.}

In this paper, we propose design principles and describe an implementation of animmersive authoring system for AR. More importantly, we present a formal user study demonstrating its benefits and weaknesses. In particular, our results demonstrate that, compared to using the traditional 2D desktop development method, immersive authoring gained significant efficiency in specifying spatial arrangements and behavior tasks, a major component of AR content authoring. However, it was not so successful for abstract tasks such as logical programming.

Virtual reality (VR) – one of the promising technologies at the base of Industry 4.0 – is able to address the design issues of CMSs, and even decrease costs and time when employed from the initial conception to the final validation of production lines, since it facilitates their virtual commissioning, i.e., it enables the full verification of systems and related components by virtual inspection and tests. Despite the above advantages, VR is still rarely used in the design of CMSs, and there is no standard VR approach in industry yet. In addition, the related scientific literature is scarce and often limited to small or simplified cases. To fill this gap, this work presents a novel VR-based approach for designing CMSs, composed of four phases: Three-dimensional CAD Export, Model Import, Scene Creation, and VR Review. The proposed approach is applied to a real industrial use case related to the virtual commissioning of an electric axles production line and it is evaluated through a questionnaire from industry professionals. The case study shows that using the VR technology enhanced the technical communication between experts in the teamwork, and it was particularly effective in finding ergonomics flaws like issues in visibility, reach, and posture using a virtual golden zone. In addition, all users found the VR interaction enjoyable and easy to learn, and beginner users perceived a comparable workload as advanced users.}

The challenging aspect of the approach proposed in this work relies in the quality evaluation of virtual prototypes of new industrial products (i.e. concept designs) by adopting a statistical procedure previously applied to service industries. Following this approach, the optimal concept design is defined at the end of a process consisting of five phases: identification of the quality elements of the concept design, classification of the quality elements, generation and quality evaluation of product concepts and, finally, definition of the optimal concept. Currently, virtual reality (VR) environment offers the opportunity to evaluate the characteristics of different virtual prototypes by involving experts and/or customers, overcoming the need for several physical prototypes. On the other side, the dynamics of simulation and the stereoscopic visualization in VR environment provides a more realistic and impressive interaction with virtual prototypes than in CAD environment. The proposed methodology is fully exploited through two case studies: the choice of the optimal design for a traditional Neapolitan coffee maker, addressed by the Italian designer Riccardo Dalisi, and for a subassembly of a new minicar.}

The digital human is constructed with a number of templates based on anthropometry database that represent various levels of body size and shape for the end-user. The interactions between the human and a product model are captured by the viewer, and thus, simulate the user operation of the product. According to the Chaffin's biomechanical model, the ergonomic engine then computes the physical loads of body joints with the captured information. The result enables online evaluation of the product design from the ergonomic aspects. It also serves as a base of interactive product customization. This research is the first study that realizes the web-based ergonomic evaluation for 3D car interior design with no needs of high-end CAD systems or complex VR environment.

abstract = {Nowadays, computer graphics courses are usually taught with traditional teaching methodologies and tools, which have several limitations. In this paper, we present an online interactive computer graphics (CG) tutorial, which supports the collaborative learning of the concepts and algorithms of computer graphics in a networked virtual environment. The practical part of the tutorial consists of example programs for users to test the theoretical concepts and to obtain their own experiments. The integration of the different theoretical and practical parts of the course is realized through a common Web-based interface to the system. The main objectives are to (1) allow the users to learn and practice with the algorithms of computer graphics in a virtual environment, (2) support avatar-based collaborative learning based on avatars involving, several users connected through the Internet. Two versions of the system in Chinese and English language, respectively, have been implemented and are described in the paper.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a Virtual Reality (VR) system for modelling and optimisation of Rapid Prototyping (RP) processes. The system aims to reduce the manufacturing risks of prototypes early in a product development cycle, and hence, reduces the number of costly design-build-test cycles. It involves modelling and simulation of RP in a virtual system, which facilitates visualisation and testing the effects of process parameters on the part quality. Modelling of RP is based on quantifying the measures of part quality, which includes accuracy, build-time and efficiency with orientation, layer thickness and hatch distance. A mathematical model has been developed to estimate the build-time of the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) process. The model incorporates various process parameters like layer thickness, hatch space, bed temperatures, laser power and sinter factor, etc. It has been integrated with the virtual simulation system to provide a test-bed to optimise the process parameters.}

Also, an additional comparison technique for comparing sub-component alternatives is developed, called “scoring matrix”. In this technique, pair-wise comparisons are performed within one matrix for all possible criteria to measure the strength of one-to-one relationship between sub-component alternatives. This technique is more appropriate than traditional analytical hierarchy process in addressing problems such as the comparison of sub-component alternatives. An illustrative example demonstrates the application of our methodology to the design of a computer system.}

abstract = {Progressive digitization in the development phase of systems is leading to shorter development times and lower costs. At the same time, the interactions in more complex systems are increasing and become more nested, which affects the understanding of system dependencies for humans as well as modeling these. This results in the challenge of digitizing the knowledge (rules, regulations, requirements, etc.) required to describe the system and its interrelationships. An example of such a system is the aircraft. In practice, usually, the technical design of the cabin and its systems is done separately from the preliminary aircraft design and the cabin results will be integrated late in the aircraft development process. In this paper, a proposal is given for a conceptual design method that enables a cabin systems layout based on preliminary aircraft design data (parameter set). Therefore, a central data model is developed that links cabin components to several disciplines to enable an automated layout. Here, knowledge is stored in an ontology. Linking the ontology with design rules and importing external parameters, missing information needed for preliminary design of cabin systems can be generated. The design rules are based on requirements, safety regulations as well as expert knowledge for design interpretation that has been collected and formalized. Using the ontology, an XML data structure can be instantiated which contains all information about properties, system relationships and requirements. So, the metadata and results of heterogenous domain-specific models and software tools are accessible for all experts of the layout process in a holistic manner and ensure data consistency. Using this XML data structure, a 3D virtual cabin mockup is created in which users have the possibility to interact with cabin modules and system components via controllers. This virtual development platform enables an interaction with complex product data sets like the XML file by visualizing metadata and analysis results along with the cabin geometry, making it even better comprehensible and processable for humans. So, various new cabin system designs can be iterated, evaluated, and optimized at low cost before the concepts are validated in a real prototype. For this, the virtual environment provides a platform that integrates all related disciplines, experts, research partners or the entire supply chain to improve communication among all stakeholders by directly participating and intervening in the evaluation and optimization process. Moreover, the use of VR is being investigated as a new technology in pre-design phase to exploit the potential of knowledge acquisition in immersive environments early in the development stage.}

The VP system comprises a suite of software packages for multi-material layered manufacturing (MMLM) processes, including multi-toolpath planning, build-time estimation and accuracy analysis, integrated with semi-immersive desktop-based and full-immersive CAVE-based virtual reality (VR) technology. Such versatility makes the VP system adaptable to suit specific cost and functionality requirements of various applications. The desktop-based VR system creates a semi-immersive environment for stereoscopic visualisation and quality analysis of a product design. It is relatively cost-effective and easy to operate, but its users may be distracted by environmental disturbances that could possibly diminish their efficiency of product design evaluation and improvement. To alleviate disturbance problems, the CAVE-based VR system provides an enclosed room-like environment that blocks out most disturbances, making it possible for a design team to fully concentrate and collaborate on their product design work. The VP system enhances collaboration and communication of a design team working on product development. It provides simulation techniques to analyse and improve the design of a product and its fabrication processes. Through simulations, assessment and modification of a product design can be iterated without much worry about the manufacturing and material costs of prototypes. Hence, key factors such as product shape, manufacturability, and durability that affect the profitability of manufactured products are optimised quickly. Moreover, the resulting product design can be sent via the Internet to customers for comments or marketing purposes. The VP system therefore facilitates advanced product design and helps reduce development time and cost considerably.}

The impacts of this paradigm shift on the human operators who continue to work alongside and symbiotically with these technologies in the industry bring with it novel ethical issues. Therefore, how to design these technologies for human values becomes the critical area of intervention. This paper takes up the case study of robotic AI-based assistance systems to explore the potential value implications that emerge due to current design practices and use. The design methodology known as Value Sensitive Design (VSD) is proposed as a sufficient starting point for designing these technologies for human values to address these issues.}

The paper presents the synthesis of a real-time metamodel to support requirements analysis of a MAS. The metamodel describes a collection of modelling units and constraints that can be used to identify the real-time requirements of a multi-agent system during the analysis phase. The paper takes the view that the earlier you model real-time requirements in the software development life cycle, the more reliable and robust the resultant system will be. Furthermore, the more likely it is an appropriate balance between competing time requirements will be achieved.

abstract = {In the current “mass customization” scenario, product complexity is increasing significantly due to the necessity to answer as quickly and effectively as possible to many different costumer needs but maintaining costs under control. In this scenario, requirements management becomes a fundamental features for the entire product lifecycle, as enterprises need to have a complete and clear idea of the market for succeeding in developing and supporting the right and innovative product. Moreover, considering that product lifecycle is characterized by many “trade-off”, so that product features are often negotiated in order to fulfil to conflicting requirements, it is important to support the “traceability” of the entire lifecycle “negotiation” process. For this reason, PLM platform has to provide suitable methodologies and tools able to efficiently support the design and management of large set of complex requirements. Requirements Management Tools (RMt) embedded in PLM solutions help keeping specifications consistent, up-to-date, and accessible. At present, there are different possible solutions, but a shared PLM integrated seems not to be available. In order to fill this gap, this paper has developed an user-based strategy, based on Kano methodology, so on “user satisfaction”, in order to define a structured set of guidelines to support the design of the features of an integrated PLM requirement management tool.}

Traditionally, content distribution networks (CDN) were used extensively to meet quality of service levels for IP video services. To handle the dramatic growth in video traffic, CDN operators are migrating their infrastructure to the cloud and fog in order to leverage its greater availability and flexibility. For hyperscale deployments, energy consumption, cache placement, and resource availability can be analyzed using simulation in order to improve resource utilization and performance. Recently, a discrete-time simulator for modelling hierarchical virtual CDNs (vCDNs) was proposed with reduced memory requirements and increased performance using multi-core systems to cater for the scale and complexity of these networks. The first iteration of this discrete-time simulator featured a number of limitations impacting accuracy and applicability: it supports only tree-based topology structures, the results are computed per level, and requests of the same content differ only in time duration. In this paper, we present an improved simulation framework that (a) supports graph-based network topologies, (b) requests have been reconstituted for differentiation of requirements, and (c) statistics are now computed per site and network metrics per link, improving granularity and parallel performance. Moreover, we also propose a two phase optimization scheme that makes use of simulation outputs to guide the search for optimal cache placements. In order to evaluate our proposal, we simulate a vCDN network based on real traces obtained from the BT vCDN infrastructure, and analyze performance and scalability aspects.}

Variant-Rich Systems (VRSs), such as Software Product Lines or variants created through clone & own, aim at reusing existing assets. The long lifespan of families of variants, and the scale of both the code base and the workforce make VRS maintenance and evolution a challenge. Visualization tools are a needed companion.
Objective:
We aim at mapping the current state of visualization interventions in the area of VRS evolution. We tackle evolution in both functionality and architecture. Three research questions are posed: What sort of analysis is being conducted to assess VRS evolution? (Analysis perspective); What sort of visualizations are displayed? (Visualization perspective); What is the research maturity of the reported interventions? (Maturity perspective).
Methods:
We performed a systematic mapping study including automated search in digital libraries, expert knowledge, and snowballing.
Results:
The study reports on 41 visualization approaches to cope with VRS evolution. Analysis wise, feature identification and location is the most popular scenario, followed by variant integration towards a Software Product Line. As for visualization, nodelink diagram visualization is predominant while researchers have come up with a wealth of ingenious visualization approaches. Finally, maturity wise, almost half of the studies are solution proposals. Most of the studies provide proof-of-concept, some of them also include publicly available tools, yet very few face proof-of-value.
Conclusions:
This study introduces a comparison framework where to frame future studies. It also points out distinct research gaps worth investigating as well as shortcomings in the evidence about relevance and contextual considerations (e.g., scalability).}

Not only its functionality for the task to be performed, but also its resultant impact on the software development process determine acceptance of an architecture for reuse. Software reuse is similar to both software tool assessment/technology transfer and requirements analysis in that in all three cases one needs to assess not only product functionality but also its resultant impact on the way that the users of the product work. The DoD is now mandating the use of the High Level Architecture Standard (HLA) for distributed military simulations. Because of our experience in architecture reuse, we realize that HLA adoption will impact not only our product, but also the way we work. In addition to examining HLA functionality, we are assessing HLA's impact on our existing development processes and standards.}

For the manufacturing corporations that provide maintenance services, the efficiency of industrial maintenance plays a crucial role in the competitiveness and is tightly related to the technical documentation supporting maintenance. However, the process of documentation creation faces several challenges due to lack of access to the physical equipment and difficulties in remote communication between globally distributed departments. To address these shortcomings, this research investigates the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) to facilitate asynchronous collaboration of globally dispersed departments involved in the pipeline of maintenance method and documentation creation. The presented proof-of-concept (the COVE-VR platform) has been developed as an academia-industry collaboration and evaluated iteratively with subject matter experts. The proposed VR platform consists of two virtual environments and eight virtual tools, which allow interaction with virtual prototypes (3D CAD models) and means of digital content creation. Our findings show the high relevance of the developed solution for the needs of industrial departments and the ability to support asynchronous collaboration among them. This article delivers qualitative findings on the value of VR technology and presents guidelines on how to develop virtual tools for digital content creation within VR, adaptable to other industrial contexts. We suggest providing embedded guidance and design consistency to ensure smooth interactions with virtual tools and further discuss the importance of proper positioning, the transparency of operations and the information property of generated content.}

The major focus has been given to the implementation of holonic control into the small to medium size manufacturing enterprises (SMEs). The ‘virtual holonic factory’ concept has been introduced, as a test bed for integration of a holonic control into a virtual factory, i.e. three-dimensional VR model of a factory in order to visually realize the effects of holonic control, when implemented to a real manufacturing system. A case study has been carried out in a medium size die-casting manufacturing plant. Through the virtual factory, a holonic control architecture for flow-line manufacturing system has been implemented for dynamic scheduling of machines in the medium size factory in order to achieve robustness necessary to handle the disturbances. The system performance and key attributes of the holonic control, such as re-configurability and robustness, have been tested and validated by using VR technology and analysis results have been presented.}

You could also call it the reverse approach of Augmented Reality (AR). We see the main application in the medical field, for example with Highly Sensitive Persons (HSP). These individuals experience immense sensory and psychological overload. Due to the stressful situations caused by the disruptive stimuli, mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety disorders or somatoform disorders can develop and manifest. Up to now, there are only a few possibilities to offer help to these persons and thus prevent the symptoms. Therapies or participation in self-help groups can be mentioned as means of help. Interestingly, there are no digital aids for HSP so far, neither wearables nor mobile applications. By using Adjusted Reality, the aforementioned consequences should at best be avoided, or at least mitigated, by reducing the physical stimuli before they reach the sensory cells. The functionality of Adjusted Reality is therefore designed as an intelligent, AI-assisted and multimodal wearable system. Sensory input is personalized in the system, digitally modified, and delivered in an attenuated version to the sensory cells and finally to the brain. Through the use of Adjusted Reality, individuals are expected to relax and feel more comfortable with themselves, including their situation within society. In general, due to its omnipotent possibilities, Adjusted Reality can be relevant whenever physical experiences can be specifically reduced.

Empowered with smart capabilities, smart PSS has great potential in creating positive user experience (UX). The requirements analysis is an essential task for successful development of smart PSS with strong UX. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the requirement analysis of smart PSS by incorporating smart-enabled UX perspective. Hence, this paper proposes a framework of user experience-oriented smart service requirement (UXO-SSR) analysis for smart PSS development. At first, the relevant factors (e.g., user personas and activity journey) are integrated to conceptualize the UX in smart PSS context. Second, a four-phase model is proposed for identifying UXO-SSR, which can provide an effective tool for acquiring UX requirements of smart PSS from holistic perspective. Third, a novel asymmetric trapezium cloud-based uncertain linguistic BWM approach is developed to evaluate the priority of the identified UXO-SSRs. The approach can appropriately handle the hybrid uncertainties (i.e., hesitancy, fuzziness and randomness) of linguistic evaluation information, thereby improving the accuracy of evaluation results. Finally, a case study of smart sleep service system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed framework.}

However, the following critical issues in Smart PSS conceptual design have not been well addressed: how to improve the solution of Smart PSS in the conceptual design stage to meet user emotional requirements. Aiming to fill the gap, this work proposes a conceptual design method for Smart PSS from the perspective of analyzing user-generated emotions/feelings. Specifically, the relevant traditional products are identified, and their public review data is used to analyze user emotions/feelings in user-product interaction. Interactive emotion board as a new design tool is presented to organize the user-generated emotions/feelings, associated design elements, and the potential design points of the initial solution. And the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is utilized to evaluate the improved solution. To ensure the efficiency of the analysis process, the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm is utilized in the process of clustering product samples and Kansei words. A case study of smart electric bicycle service system (SEBSS) design is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

abstract = {Background
Machine learning-based beer bottle-defect detection is a complex technology that runs automatically; however, it consumes considerable memory, is expensive, and poses a certain danger when training novice operators. Moreover, some topics are difficult to learn from experimental lectures, such as digital image processing and computer vision. However, virtual simulation experiments have been widely used to good effect within education. A virtual simulation of the design and manufacture of a beer bottle-defect detection system will not only help the students to increase their image-processing knowledge, but also improve their ability to solve complex engineering problems and design complex systems.
Methods
The hardware models for the experiment (camera, light source, conveyor belt, power supply, manipulator, and computer) were built using the 3DS MAX modeling and animation software. The Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) game engine was utilized to build a virtual design room, design the interactive operations, and simulate the system operation.
Results
The results showed that the virtual-simulation system received much better experimental feedback, which facilitated the design and manufacture of a beer bottle-defect detection system. The specialized functions of the functional modules in the detection system, including a basic experimental operation menu, power switch, image shooting, image processing, and manipulator grasping, allowed students (or virtual designers) to easily build a detection system by retrieving basic models from the model library, and creating the beer-bottle transportation, image shooting, image processing, defect detection, and defective-product removal. The virtual simulation experiment was completed with image processing as the main body.
Conclusions
By mainly focusing on bottle mouthdefect detection, the detection system dedicates more attention to the user and the task. With more detailed tasks available, the virtual system will eventually yield much better results as a training tool for imageprocessing education. In addition, a novel visual perception-thinking pedagogical framework enables better comprehension than the traditional lecture-tutorial style.}

abstract = {With the widespread application of networked information-based technologies throughout industry manufacturing, modern manufacturing facilities give rise to unprecedented levels of process data generation. Data-rich manufacturing environments provide a broad stage on which advanced data analytics play leading roles in creating manufacturing intelligence to support operational efficiency and process innovation. In this paper, we introduce a process data analysis solution that integrates the technologies of situation awareness and visual analytics for the routine monitoring and troubleshooting of roller hearth kiln (RHK), a complex key manufacturing facility for lithium battery cathode materials. Guided by a set of detailed scenarios and requirement analyses, we first propose a qualitative and quantitative situation assessment model to generate the comprehensive description of RHK's operating situation. An informative visual analysis system then is designed and implemented to enhance the users’ abilities of situation perception and understanding for insightful anomaly root cause reasoning and efficient decision making. We conduct case studies and a user interview together with the managers and operators from manufacturing sites as system evaluation. The result demonstrates its effectiveness and prospects its possible inspiration for other similar scenarios about complex manufacturing facility monitoring in smart factories.}

Supporting such practices brings significant advantages to patients, their family, formal and informal caregivers, clinicians, and researchers. This paper presents a focus group with experts in physiotherapy and telerehabilitation, debating on the requirements, current techniques and technologies developed to facilitate and enhance the effectiveness of telerehabilitation, and the still open challenges. Particular emphasis is given to (i) the body-parts requiring the most rehabilitation, (ii) the typical environments, initial causes, and general conditions, (iii) the values and parameters to be observed, (iv) common errors and limitations of current practices and technological solutions, and (v) the envisioned and desired technological support. Consequently, it has been performed a systematic review of the state of the art, investigating what types of systems and support currently cope with telerehabilitation practices and possible matches with the outcomes of the focus group. Technological solutions based on video analysis, wearable devices, robotic support, distributed sensing, and gamified telerehabilitation are examined. Particular emphasis is given to solutions implementing agent-based approaches, analyzing and discussing strength, limitations, and future challenges. By doing so, it has been possible to relate functional requirements expressed by professional physiotherapists and researchers, with the need for extending multi-agent systems (MAS) peculiarities at the sensing level in wearable solutions establishing new research challenges. In particular, to be employed in safety-critical cyber-physical scenarios with user-sensor and sensor-sensor interactions, MAS are requested to handle timing constraints, scarcity of resources and new communication means, crucial to providing real-time feedback and coaching. Therefore, MAS pillars such as the negotiation protocol and the agent's internal scheduler have been investigated, proposing solutions to achieve the aforementioned real-time compliance.}

Virtual inspection tools have been used proficiently to show cultural artifacts either through the web or in museum exhibits. The usability of the user interface has been recognized to play a crucial role in overcoming the typical fearful attitude of the cultural heritage community towards 3D graphics. In this paper we discuss the design of the user interface for the virtual inspection of the impressive entrance of the Ripoll Monastery in Spain. The system was exhibited in the National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC) and it is now part of the Romanesque exhibition at the MAPFRE foundation. The MNAC is the third most visited art museum in Spain, and features the world's largest collection on Romanesque Art. We analyze the requirements from museum curators and discuss the main interface design decisions. The user interface combines (a) focus-plus-context visualization, with focus (detail view) and context (overview) being shown at separate displays, (b) touch-based camera control techniques, and (c) continuous feedback about the exact location of the detail area within the entrance. The interface allows users to aim the camera at any point of the entrance with centimeter accuracy using a single tap. We provide the results of a user study comparing our user interface with alternative approaches. We also discuss the benefits the exhibition had to the cultural heritage community.}

During the rehabilitation process, it is important to confront the patient with (everyday) tasks that have increasing degrees of difficulty to improve their performance. Immersive virtual reality training offers the potential to create a better transfer to daily life than non-immersive computer training. In cooperation with two neuropsychologists, an immersive virtual environment (VE) was developed in which cognitive training in the form of safe road crossing decisions can be performed. We present the experimental exploration and evaluation of difficulty factors within such a VR-based cognitive rehabilitation program. Four difficulty factors were identified and compared (number of relevant traffic lanes, speed of vehicles, distance between vehicles, and number of vehicles). The combination of these difficulty factors resulted in 36 training scenarios. The impact of the factors on participant performance and subjective perception of scenario difficulty were evaluated with 60 healthy participants to estimate the impact of the four factors to a situation’s difficulty level. For the factors Relevant Lanes and Traffic Speed a clear influence on the perceived task difficulty could be determined. No clear influence could be found for the Gap Size. The Number of Vehicles had almost no effect on the perceived task difficulty. Finally, we asked two experienced neuropsychologists about the applicability of our developed system to patients, and they stated that the system is ready for a study on patients.}

It allows the elderly to get rid of the constraints of reality and perform social activities stably and continuously, providing new ideas for alleviating the loneliness of the elderly. Through the analysis of the needs of the elderly, a virtual social center framework for the elderly was proposed in this study. Besides, a prototype system was designed according to the framework. The elderly can socialize in virtual reality with metaverse-related technologies and human-computer interaction tools. Additionally, a test was jointly conducted with the chief physician of the geriatric rehabilitation department of a tertiary hospital. The results demonstrated that the mental state of the elderly who had used the virtual social center was significantly better than that of the elderly who had not used it. Thus, virtual social centers alleviated loneliness and depression in older adults. Virtual social centers can help the elderly relieve loneliness and depression when the global epidemic is normalizing and the population is aging. Hence, they have promotion value}

These devices are predominantly used for aerial surveying in sensitive and remote areas. It is alarming that issues pertaining to stalking and information control have increased with the growth of technology. This paper presents a Blockchain Technology (BCT) based solution to improve the security and privacy of VC based device data. The proposed design is evaluated by implementing an IoT based application in a virtual vehicle monitoring system. The technical information about the instructions to the vehicle (devices), authentication, integrity, and vehicle reactions are stored in a cloud platform wherein Pentatope based Elliptic curve cryptography and SHA are used to ensure privacy in data storage. The data is later stored in an Ethereum based public blockchain to enable seamless BCT transactions. This system uses the Ganache platform for BCT that ensures data protection and privacy. Furthermore, metamask wallet for Ethbalance is required to perform transactions over BCT. The proposed methodology thus helps to protect data from stalkers, plaintext attacks as well as ciphertext attacks. The results, when compared with the state-of-the-art, justify the efficiency and security aspects of the proposed approach.}

To face these challenges, governments and decision makers undertake smart city projects targeting sustainable economic growth and better quality of life for both inhabitants and visitors. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key enabling technology for city smartening. However, ICT artifacts and applications yield massive volumes of data known as big data. Extracting insights and hidden correlations from big data is a growing trend in information systems to provide better services to citizens and support the decision making processes. However, to extract valuable insights for developing city level smart information services, the generated datasets from various city domains need to be integrated and analyzed. This process usually referred to as big data analytics or big data value chain. Surveying the literature reveals an increasing interest in harnessing big data analytics applications in general and in the area of smart cities in particular. Yet, comprehensive discussions on the essential characteristics of big data analytics frameworks fitting smart cities requirements are still needed. This paper presents a novel big data analytics framework for smart cities called “Smart City Data Analytics Panel — SCDAP”. The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches.}

This consideration should also apply to cultural heritage, not only conservation. In the context of globalization, smart actions for content use should be carried out to provide sustainability of national identities. In the last decades, new technologies have been developed and used for digital conservation in the form of three-dimensional computer models with varying size, starting from very small museum exhibits and ending with the largest cathedrals and castles. The benefits computer models are undeniable. By prototyping and reverse engineering, significant exhibits are developed providing possibilities not only to see, but also to hold in one's hands and interact thereby allowing a better understanding of historical events and their meaning. Three-dimensional visualization provides virtual tours in different places and in different times. Unfortunately, development of such content is very expensive. Furthermore, technologies for a successful immersion level are in the development phase. This applies to criteria of content quality and availability and functionality of interaction. It is also vital to understand what elements to virtualize and how it lines up with the provision of national identity. Competition and tourism promotion conditions are undoubtedly a significant driving force for technological development, but, from an identity sustainability point of view, it is important that they go hand in hand. The aim of this research is to develop a baseline design for a set of technologies and the use of virtual and augmented reality to find recommendations for the sustainability of the national identity of countries via the prism of cultural heritage. Thereby providing planned and global technological solutions that are not aimed towards individual museums and separate objects of cultural heritage but focused on the overall region in the specialisation of ancient sites.}

However, to the authors' best knowledge, there is still a lack of a holistic summary of DDPD with chronological concern in the intelligence age.

The results shown that DDPD has vitality in the Intelligence Age by combining the cutting-edge digital technologies, such as AI, additive manufacturing, digital twin, and so on. Moreover, current DDPD studies could outperform the classical design methods on the well-defined tasks, but it still cannot master the creative/innovative design tasks which require the cognitive capability. This survey further highlights several future research potentials including cognitive intelligence-enabled design, end-to-end design integration, advanced design knowledge support, design for additive manufacturing, and sustainable smart product-service systems. It is hoped that this work can be regarded as a reference to understand the roadmap of DDPD and offer insights for the design practitioners to complete relevant tasks in today’s intelligence age.}

abstract = {Product design is a highly involved, often ill-defined, complex and iterative process, and the needs and specifications of the required artifact get more refined only as the design process moves toward its goal. An effective computer support tool that helps the designer make better-informed decisions requires efficient knowledge representation schemes. In today’s world, there is a virtual explosion in the amount of raw data available to the designer, and knowledge representation is critical in order to sift through this data and make sense of it. In addition, the need to stay competitive has shrunk product development time through the use of simultaneous and collaborative design processes, which depend on effective transfer of knowledge between teams. Finally, the awareness that decisions made early in the design process have a higher impact in terms of energy, cost, and sustainability, has resulted in the need to project knowledge typically required in the later stages of design to the earlier stages. Research in design rationale systems, product families, systems engineering, and ontology engineering has sought to capture knowledge from earlier product design decisions, from the breakdown of product functions and associated physical features, and from customer requirements and feedback reports. VR (Virtual reality) systems and multidisciplinary modeling have enabled the simulation of scenarios in the manufacture, assembly, and use of the product. This has helped capture vital knowledge from these stages of the product life and use it in design validation and testing. While there have been considerable and significant developments in knowledge capture and representation in product design, it is useful to sometimes review our position in the area, study the evolution of research in product design, and from past and current trends, try and foresee future developments. The goal of this paper is thus to review both our understanding of the field and the support tools that exist for the purpose, and identify the trends and possible directions research can evolve in the future.}

abstract = {This paper presents results of the first phase of the research project “Serious Human Rescue Game” at Technische Universität Darmstadt. It presents a new serious gaming approach based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the exploration of the effect of building condition on human behavior during the evacuation process. In reality it is impossible to conduct rescue tests in burning buildings to study the human behavior. Therefore, the current methods of data-collecting for existing evacuation simulation models have limitations regarding the individual human factors. To overcome these limitations the research hypothesis is that the human behavior can be explored with a serious computer game: The decisions of a person during the game should be comparable to decisions during an extreme situation in the real world. To verify this hypothesis, this paper introduces a serious gaming approach for analyzing the human behavior in extreme situations. To implement a serious game, developers generally make use of 3D-modeling software to generate the game content. After this, the game logic needs to be added to the content with special software development kits for computer games. Every new game scenario has to be built manually from scratch. This is time-consuming and a great share of modeling work needs to be executed twice (e.g., 3D-modeling), at first by the architect for the parametric building model and the second time by the game designer for the 3D-game content. The key idea of the presented approach is to use the capabilities of BIM together with engineering simulations (fire, smoke) to build realistic serious game scenarios in a new and efficient way. This paper presents the first phase results of the research project mainly focusing on the conceptual design of the serious game prototype. The validation concept is also presented. The inter-operability between building information modeling applications and serious gaming platforms should allow different stakeholders to simulate building-related scenarios in a new, interactive and efficient way.}

abstract = {Digital transformation (DT), the combination of information, computing, communication and connectivity technologies, which has triggered an effective upgrade of different aspects of market strategy, customer experience etc. Nowadays, rehabilitation assistive devices (RADs) are evolving to be more digital, intelligent and personalized. Digitalization and servitization have fostered to an emerging business model—the smart product–service system (Smart PSS). Therefore, DT of the RADs’ industry advocates not only the design of products and functions, the more important is the management of service processes and resource integration. With the increase in the elderly and disabled population, the requirement for RADs is becoming more urgent. However, research on Smart PSS for RAD is still limited. The rehabilitation assistive smart product–service systems (RASPSS) was introduced into the development of RADs based on the “Design and Management of DT” strategy through the service design of assistive devices and user requirements analysis. Further, an integrated design of RAD and Smart PSS has been created, a development method of RASPSS proposed, the theoretical model of the Smart PSS based on RADs built. To specify the service framework, this case study discusses the development of a home rehabilitation assistive system for femoral stem fracture patients. This paper evaluates the usability of the system, the results of which prove usability and effectiveness of the RASPSS development method. The RASPSS development model is designed to meet needs of stakeholders, improve the user rehabilitation experience, promote the service innovation of Smart PSS, bring certain market benefits of rehabilitation aids and create social value.}

This survey was conducted with 350 people from South Korea, and TAM was used to analyze the acceptability of virtual reality. User adoption behaviors were analyzed rigorously, adding perceived enjoyment, social interactions, and strength of the social ties to the basic TAM. The results of this study indicate that social interactions and strength of the social ties increase perceived enjoyment, and perceived enjoyment has a more significant effect on intention to use than perceived usefulness, which is the main element of TAM. These results have theoretical implications for consumer adoption behavior and empirical implications for the best marketing strategies for virtual reality devices.}

We tested an important part of the model using an experimental design in which 140 middle school students were class-wise shown an informative virtual reality demonstration that incorporated either a realistic or an unrealistic (fantasy) interface character, or no character. Findings show, first, no persona effect on task performance. We discuss how user engagement might be related to persona effects. Second, designed realism of the interface character contributed to user engagement when controlled for various user perceptions. Moreover, perceived aesthetics and task-relevance further influenced user engagement. Third, user engagement and task performance combined better predicted satisfaction than either one of the factors alone. In sum, several appearance- and task-related factors contributed to user engagement and user satisfaction. Thus, realism is not all.}

Nature holds huge potential for inspiring innovative design concepts that can meet the ever-growing need for smart products since biology perceive and interact with their living environment for survival. However, to date, very few studies have explored the application of natural wisdom in building innovative design concepts for smart products. This paper proposes a function-oriented design approach for smart products, by analogizing to biological prototypes. To do so, a unified functional representation, based on the Function–behavior–structure (FBS) ontology, is proposed to abstract biological prototypes, followed by a fuzzy triangular numbers-based algorithm designed to locate appropriate biological prototypes as analogical sources for smart product development. Moreover, functional innovative strategies and a hybrid design process are formulated to develop design concepts of smart products, by integrating several existing engineering design methods. Finally, an illustrative design case of a smart natural resource collecting system is used to demonstrate the workability of the proposed method.}

Different from other virtual pottery design systems, our approach simulates the entire physical pottery design process, such as modeling, painting, seals, firing and customization, and provides the ability to have the designed results fabricated by real artists or a 3D printer. To make the designed results manufacturable by artists, our approach imposes some industrial constraints (both geometry and decorations) when the user designs his/her personalized potteries. Our method only requires simple and intuitive interactions, so even novices can follow the workflow to create pretty potteries easily. We optimize the design process to perform real-time operations. Our informal user study shows that a first-time user typically masters the operations within 10 minutes, and can construct interesting and satisfactory 3D pottery models within minutes.}

To understand the current status of software architecture knowledge engineering and future research trends, this paper compares five architectural knowledge management tools and the support they provide in the architecture life-cycle. The comparison is based on an evaluation framework defined by a set of 10 criteria. The results of the comparison provide insights into the current focus of architectural knowledge management support, their advantages, deficiencies, and conformance to the current architectural description standard.

Thus, game development projects use feedback from game testers to understand what they think of various features and concepts, to obtain a better understanding of problem spaces. This study proposes that game tester feedback moderates the effect of Sprint planning on game quality. A field study was conducted using a pair-matched questionnaire in which 102 game development projects participated. Results showed that Sprint planning has a positive effect on game quality. The results also revealed that iterative feedback has a moderating effect on the relationship between Sprint planning and game quality. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

However, the majority of the research focuses on the technological aspects and enabling technologies, mainly directing to the robotic side, and usually neglecting the human factors. This work deals with including the needs of the humans interacting with robots in the design in human-robot interaction (HRI). In particular, the paper proposes a user experience (UX)-oriented structured method to investigate the human-robot dialogue to map the interaction with robots during the execution of shared tasks, and to finally elicit the requirements for the design of valuable HRI. The research adopted the proposed method to an industrial case focused on assembly operations supported by collaborative robots and AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles). A multidisciplinary team was created to map the HRI for the specific case with the final aim to define the requirements for the design of the system interfaces. The novelty of the proposed approach is the inclusion of typically interaction design tools focusing in the analysis of the UX into the design of the system components, without merely focusing on the technological issues. Experimental results highlighted the validity of the proposed method to identify the interaction needs and to drive the interface design.}

Inherently, it follows an iterative process based on interactive technical dialogues in a 3D computer simulated office. The tool is designed to assess the novice engineering practitioners knowledge and provide preliminary training for ISO/IEC 12207:1995 processes. By playing such a game, participants are able to learn about the details of this standard. The present study provides a framework for the exploration of research data obtained from computer engineering students. Results suggest that there is a significant difference between the knowledge gained among the students who have played Floors and those who have only participated in paper-based learning sessions. Our findings indicate that participants who played Floors tend to have greater knowledge of the ISO/IEC 12207:1995 standard, and as a result, we recommend the use of serious games that seem to be superior to traditional paper based approach.}

Many studies have thusly been conducted to design and develop the smart PSS, while i) how to identify multi-source requirements through reviewing the entire service interaction cycle, ii) how to define and deduce the innovative smart connected products (SCPs) features under contradictory interests, and iii) how to specify the functional and data service configuration solutions are still unclear. To tackle these problems, a knowledge-driven approach was introduced to better organize the multi-source design knowledge and deduce service recommendations for personalized user demands. Specifically, a user journey map-based method was proposed for knowledge elicitation of the specific user demands. To organize the user knowledge for better understanding, hierarchical personalized user requirements (PURs) analytics were proposed to quantitively transfer PURs into proper design engineering parameters. To inspire the problem-solving logic for design solution generation, TRIZ inventive principles were retrieved and referred to. With the generated design concept, the service logic diagrams were structured to define the personalized service content of SCPs. Having the service logic and SCPs, the overall service network of the user-centric smart PSS can be outlined. The proposed approach was demonstrated and validated in the digital health area via a case study on smart test tube rack (STTR) design, and it was validated from an economic feasibility perspective. It showed that the STTR was promising to reduce manual work, improve the nurses' performance, and enhance patients’ medical experience. Furthermore, it was suggested that the proposed approach can effectively guide the innovative SCPs creation in a straightforward and instructive manner, and is promising to process the service solution deduction and improve the efficiency of service creation in real practice.}

Scholars are focusing on the theoretical architecture and implementing applications, in order to establish a high-fidelity, dynamic, and full-lifecycle DT model and achieve a deep fusion of real and virtual. As a typical complex system with multi-disciplines, multi-physics, and multi-domain characteristics, industrial robot (IR) involves various processes and elements from the two other levels of the system: components and production lines. Their complex relationships lead to a huge challenge to build a comprehensive DT model. Current researchers usually concentrates on single-layer services because of limited construction methodology, which results in enormous isolated models, and leads to low reusable system blocks, finite scalability, and high costs of design, adjustment, upgrade, and maintenance. To address these issues, a standardized methodology and a hierarchical, modular, and generic architecture are proposed to depict comprehensive and variable industrial robot digital twin (IRDT). Firstly, the ontology information model is presented by analyzing variable factors systematically. Then, model-based system engineering (MBSE) based methodology is introduced, including construction process and variants management. After modeling process of three levels (problem domain, solution main, and implementation domain) and four viewpoints (requirement, structure, behavior, and parameter), a generic architecture of IRDT is constructed and a feature-based variants management method is described. Besides, a six-axis IRDTS is implemented to illustrate the mapping of logical architecture and physical system as a multi-level elements and processes representation example. And the steps of numerical evaluations consist of system delay and derivation. Finally, results show the effectiveness and the potential of the proposed theoretical methodology for constructing IRDTS and other industrial applications.}

As few users were involved during the initial development of SimuSurvey, many instructors and students were skeptical about the innovative application of SimuSurvey in actual surveying classes. To address this problem, we proposed and applied an iterative and incremental user-centered design method to redevelop the tool. Three hundred and forty-six users including 5 instructors, 4 surveying experts, and 337 students, with different backgrounds were introduced at different stages of the redevelopment process. After two iterations of complete redevelopment cycles with five intermediate prototype systems generated, a much improved version of the tool, namely SimuSurvey R2, was developed. From the final interviews with students and the field observation on user groups, SimuSurvey R2 has been shown to be more practical for use in actual surveying classes. In addition, the proposed user-centered approach and several techniques it employs, such as storyboards and content diagrams, paper-based prototyping, high-fidelity prototyping, and usability tests, have been found to be effective for improvement (or redevelopment) of software systems.}

The main idea of the Naked world is that all the services which are currently provided by gadgets will be provided by the infrastructure, thus no gadgets will be needed to use any kind of digital services. When a user in the Naked world intends to use a service, the infrastructure senses the user, the nearby intelligent surrounding launches an interactive user interface, performs identification through biometric identities, provides the service, and then closes the session when the user finishes the job. Therefore, the Naked world comprises highly intelligent and context-aware interactive environments. The vision of the Naked world is an evolution towards a user-friendly and ubiquitously available digital services, which is naturally bounded by the technological advancement. Henceforth, this paper presents the essential technologies and functional requirements along with the current and forthcoming novel technological concepts and challenges for the realization of the Naked world.}

Depression among children and teens may go unrecognized and untreated, as parents and teachers may have difficulty recognizing the symptoms. COVID-19 has changed traditional learning methods, forcing children to stay home and connect through online education. Although some children may function reasonably well in less-structured environments, many children with significant depression suffer a noticeable change in social activities, loss of interest in an online school, poor online academic performance, or changes in appearance. Home quarantine has affected children's mental health, and it has become challenging for school counselors to predict depression in many children participating in online education. This study aims to design and develop a tool for predicting depression among children aged 7 to 9 years old by recording students' online classes and sending a note to the child's academic file. The idea of needing this tool arose as an output for applying the design thinking approach to the online education website during COVID-19. This inspired the authors to combine the lecture recordings and the prediction of depression into one tool. Image processing techniques are applied to generate the results predicted by the model on the collected videos. The overall accuracy for classifying depressed and not depressed videos is 89%.}

abstract = {For human-robot collaboration (HRC), one of the most practical methods to ensure human safety with a vision-based system is establishing a minimum safe distance. This study proposes a novel integrated mixed reality (MR) system for safety-aware HRC using deep learning and digital twin generation. The proposed approach can accurately measure the minimum safe distance in real-time and provide MR-based task assistance to the human operator. The approach integrates MR with safety-related monitoring by tracking the shared workplace and providing user-centric visualization through smart MR glasses for safe and effective HRC. Two RGB-D sensors are used to reconstruct and track the working environment. One sensor scans one area of the physical environment through 3D point cloud data. The other also scans another area of the environment and tracks the user's 3D skeletal information. In addition, the two partially scanned environments are registered together by applying a fast global registration method to two sets of the 3D point cloud. Furthermore, deep learning-based instance segmentation is applied to the target object's 3D point cloud to increase the registration between the real robot and its virtual robot, the digital twin of the real robot. While only 3D point cloud data are widely used in previous studies, this study proposes a simple yet effective 3D offset-based safety distance calculation method based on the robot's digital twin and the human skeleton. The 3D offset-based method allows for real-time applicability without sacrificing the accuracy of safety distance calculation for HRI. In addition, two comparative evaluations were conducted to confirm the originality and advantage of the proposed MR-based HRC.}

Social aspects referred to here are the soft aspects of the organisation that lead to organic organisation development (communication, collaboration, culture, skills and personal goals). There are many EM approaches and enterprise architecture frameworks were proposed recently. These cover different enterprise aspects, perspectives, artefacts and models with different qualities and levels of details. Yet, the imperative determination has overlaid the declarative exploration in EM as a necessity of the design effort. Rethinking the assumptions underlying EM should bring a new and different understanding on how EM can be tackled within the enterprise, in particular the joint development and optimisation of socio-technical systems. This paper discusses EM from a socio-technical systems (STS) perspective, and towards forming a new model of EM that is driven from STS theory and combined with STS practices. Then proposes a conceptual integrated model that incorporates the new concepts of STS toward building an EM framework for balanced socio-technical joint development and optimisation. The approach is illustrated in a scenario from healthcare industry. A combination between modelling and STS practices proved powerful for holistic IT modernisation, future work discussed toward the end of the paper.}

Serious games for CVI are limited, especially those that train multiple visuoperceptual skills in an individualized and adaptive manner without the frequent manual input from clinicians. In this paper, we describe the design, development, and evaluation process of novel individualized and adaptive serious mini-games for visual perceptual skills. First, an informant-led design, including focus groups with relevant stakeholders implementing a participation-via-proxy and brainstorming sessions, was performed. This resulted in rapid prototypes of four mini-games (MatchMaker, Hurricane Chaos, Maze Explorer 2D, and Maze Explorer 3D), targeting six visuoperceptual skills commonly impaired in children with CVI: (1) visual discrimination and matching, (2) object or picture recognition, (3) visual spatial perception, (4) figure-ground perception, (5) motion perception, and (6) visual short-term memory. Therapeutic game content (selecting, manipulating, and rating images; defining entry-level difficulty and in-game adaptivity rules) was evaluated by clinical and research experts. Finally, formative testing and expert feedback, including usability and user experience by clinicians, researchers, and typically developing children, led to important modifications in the mini-games.}

abstract = {Freeform surfaces are popularly used to design and model complex 3D objects. These 3D models are stored as computerized models in databases. To facilitate data retrieval and shape matching, a major challenge lies in defining and computing the level of similarity between two or more freeform surfaces. In order to explore the useful 3D information associated with the surfaces, an integrated approach based on the integral of Gaussian curvature is proposed to develop the measures of similarity of freeform surfaces. Specifically, the integral of Gaussian curvature is mapped into the 2D space, and a shape-based measure is developed using statistical methods to compute the level of similarity. For smooth surfaces, a fast approximation algorithm is developed to calculate the curvature of individual subregions. In cases where the target surface has a complex topological structure or a smooth surface is not available, the integral of Gaussian curvature for the discrete surface is first calculated at each vertex, followed by mapping onto a 2D spherical coordinate. The distance measure focuses on the local geometry, which is critical to investigate models with a certain level of resemblance such as products in a family. This proposed approach can be applied to surfaces under various transformations, as well as 3D data from various sources.}

Such a model includes a number of psychological characteristics and study preferences that describe the learner's personality traits related to learning. During the last decades, the design methods and tools for e-learning have been designed assuming specific learner models. Therefore, in the search for a learning environment suitable for as many learner models as possible, we need tools to explore -and exploit- such models. In general, the learner's characteristics can be linked to the so-called learner's learning style (which is a part of the learner model) to provide the instructor with extensive knowledge about the learner's characterization in perceiving and processing information. Numerous learning styles have been proposed in the last decades, in some cases with overlapping characteristics with the same or different names. Thus, the heterogeneity of the learning style space makes it difficult to handle customization effectively. In this paper, we introduce a Learner's Characteristics Ontology based on creating interconnections between the different learning style model dimensions and learning styles with the relevant learner's characteristics, that: (1) helps instructors to improve and personalize the learning content; (2) can recommend learning materials to learners according to their learning characteristics and preferences; (3) can provide both instructors and learners with extensive knowledge about how they can improve their teaching and learning abilities; and (4) can improve communications and interaction between humans and computers by specifying the semantics of the learning style models' characteristics.}

This conceptual model is the input for a model compiler that can generate software systems by means of automatic transformations. However, in general, MDD methods focus on modelling the structure and functionality of systems, relegating the interaction and usability features to manual implementations at the last steps of the software development process. Some usability features are strongly related to the functionality of the system and their inclusion is not so easy. In order to facilitate the inclusion of functional usability features from the first steps of the development process and bring closer MDD methods to the holistic perspective, we propose a Usability Model. The Usability Model gathers conceptual primitives that represent functional usability features in a sufficiently abstract way so that the model can be used with different holistic MDD methods. This paper defines all the primitives that can be used to represent functional usability features. Moreover, we have defined a process to include the Usability Model in any MDD method without affecting its existing conceptual model. The proposal is based on model-to-model and model-to-code transformations. As proof of concept, we have applied our proposal to an existing MDD method called the OO-method and we have measured its efficiency.}

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) has been acclaimed as one of the promising technologies for advancing future UbiComp (Ubiquitous Computing) environments. Despite a myriad of AR applications and its influence on the human–computer interaction field, end products that integrate AR are less commonplace than expected. This is due to a lack of being able to forecast in which direction mainstream standardization of AR-oriented platform components will be framed. It is mainly due to a focus on technology issues in implementing reasonable AR solutions, which also results in difficulty in initiating AR research and creating prototype test-beds. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive review of AR prototyping trends and AR research activities. Through the technical review of a de facto AR prototyping method, we remark upon the key elements of AR techniques, and then present an alternative view of the AR environment centered on end-user advantages in interaction, which is characterized by three features: intuitive observation, informative visualization, and immersive interaction. In addition, we believe that these features can be used to motivate the integration of AR technology into custom-built 3D applications. In this paper, we propose a conceptual schema and an architectural framework for generic AR prototyping. On the basis of these, a video see-through AR interface is integrated into three prototype 3D applications in 3 different domains: engineering systems, geospace, and multimedia. As the case studies for validating our integration, we present three sample AR applications; (a) an AR-interfaced 3D CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) simulation test-bed, (b) a two-stage distributed Traveler Guidance Service (TGS) test-bed based on a GIS database and AR, and (c) a haptically-enhanced broadcasting test-bed for AR-based 3D media production. For each application, a description of the test-bed implementation, demonstration of the feasibility and usefulness and AR-specific technical challenges are included in this paper.}

Owing to frequent changes in user mobility and demands, service systems deployed in an edge–cloud environment must continuously adapt to ensure that the quality of service (QoS) perceived by the end users is maintained at a stable and satisfactory level. As it is difficult for system operation engineers to manually deal with such frequent and large-scale evolution due to problems of cost and efficiency, self-adaptation of the system is essential. In this paper, we present a programming framework for microservices (EPF4M) and an infrastructure for self-adaptive microservice systems (EI4MS) for the cloud–edge environment based on microservice architecture. Our study follows a “monitoring–analyzing–planning–execution” control loop that empowers the service systems to redeploy the services according to changes in the QoS. A two-phase strategy is adopted to minimize the side effects of the loop on the performance of the service system. A prototype of this framework and infrastructure has been open-sourced and verified through experiments conducted in a real cloud–edge environment. The results demonstrate the usefulness and advantages of our approach.}

This work presents well-known and mature navigation technologies used by AGV in industry: with a physical path (e.g., wire/inductive guidance, optical line guidance and magnetic tape guidance) and with a virtual path (e.g., laser based, motion capture, inertial, magnetic-gyro) to be followed by the AGV during the operations of transportation. A critical assessment is also presented regarding the performance of these technologies against the operational requirements and safety demonstration in the framework of fusion facilities like ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) or DEMO (DEMOnstration Power Station).}

In this paper, we present a case study with visually impaired pupils aiming for gaining bottom-up insights to support the ideation and design of a game editor to support orientation and mobility training. We involved relevant stakeholders (pupils, teachers, mobility trainers) using multiple methods, including (contextual) interview, focus group, (ideation) workshop, Gamestorming, digital survey, behavioural observation, self-experience, and early stage prototype testing. With our approach, we were able to gain a rich understanding of the needs of visually impaired pupils. The objective of this paper is to serve as reference for researchers cooperating with visually impaired pupils by providing (1) design implications for a game editor, and (2) a comprehensive reflection on approaches and issues of user-centred design methods with visually impaired pupils.}

The underlying argument is that databases are sufficiently different from other classes of application to necessitate a raft of user interface techniques specifically for the needs of database users which would reward increased attention by the HCI community.}

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city’s IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future.}

abstract = {Product development based on a morphological matrix involves the process of decision-based design. Although the decision process can generate conceptual schemes under the guidance of qualitative decision objectives, analysis of the interactions among the qualitative objectives is seldom considered, which can lead to unreliable optimal solutions by combining conflicting principle solutions. In addition, due to the ambiguity of the constraints among the qualitative objectives, multiple feasible schemes with equilibrium states are not considered in the concept decision stage. To solve these problems, a decision approach with multiple interactive qualitative objectives is developed for conceptual schemes based on noncooperative-cooperative game theory to consider the tradeoffs among objectives (e.g., cost, quality and operability) using discrete principle solution evaluation data. First, the morphological analysis method can obtain feasible schemes and determine the principle solutions for each subfunction. Second, the principle solutions are quantified using linguistic terms. Then, the subfunctions are categorized through cluster analysis to determine the suitable principle solution. Third, based on the clustering results, a noncooperative game decision model is constructed to identify multiple Nash equilibrium solutions that satisfy the constraints among the objectives. Fourth, a cooperative game decision model is constructed to obtain the optimal scheme as screened by the noncooperative game model. The case study proves that this approach can choose a relatively superior scheme under the existing technical conditions, thereby preventing inconsistency with the actual design expectations.}

Workflow applications are highly used in IT industries, project management, supply chain management, large distributed management, and many more. Load-balanced workflow allocation to solve all the requirements of the cloud users is already proven NP-hard. In this scenario, meta-heuristic algorithms are one of the best candidates to solve the load balancing problem in the cloud to achieve an optimal allocation schedule. In this paper, we proposed a load-balanced workflow allocation method using stochastic fractal search (SFS) algorithms to maximize the resource utilization of the virtualized cloud resources. In this way, the load imbalance on virtual machines can be minimized. SFS is an evolutionary optimization method that uses the natural growth behavior in the search process. The performance analysis is conducted by implementing the workflow load balancer in MATLAB. The study shows that the solutions achieved by the proposed SFS strategy are far better than those obtained by particle swarm optimization (PSO).}

Its application to architecture, engineering and construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) is straightforward and can be very useful to improve the on-site work at different stages of the projects. However, one of the most important limitations of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) is the lack of accuracy when the screen overlays the virtual models on the real images captured by the camera. The main reasons are errors related to tracking (positioning and orientation of the mobile device) and image capture and processing (projection and distortion issues). This paper shows a new methodology to mathematically perform a quantitative evaluation, in world coordinates, of those overlaying discrepancies on the screen, obtaining the real-scale distances from any real point to the sightlines of its virtual projections for any AR application. Additionally, a new utility for filtering built-in sensor signals in mobile devices is presented: the Drift-Vibration-Threshold function (DVT), a straightforward tool to filter the drift suffered by most sensor-based tracking systems.}

The synergies between these two fields have a long story and throughout the past decades, ED has increasingly benefited from an integration with DS. We present a literature review at the intersection between ED and DS, identifying the tools, algorithms and data sources that show the most potential in contributing to ED, and identifying a set of challenges that future data scientists and designers should tackle, to maximize the potential of DS in supporting effective and efficient designs. A rigorous scoping review approach has been supported by Natural Language Processing techniques, in order to offer a review of research across two fuzzy-confining disciplines. The paper identifies challenges related to the two fields of research and to their interfaces. The main gaps in the literature revolve around the adaptation of computational techniques to be applied in the peculiar context of design, the identification of data sources to boost design research and a proper featurization of this data. The challenges have been classified considering their impacts on ED phases and applicability of DS methods, giving a map for future research across the fields. The scoping review shows that to fully take advantage of DS tools there must be an increase in the collaboration between design practitioners and researchers in order to open new data driven opportunities.}

Availability of Co-Gen loads and/or Electric Vehicles (EVs) enable these technologies to inject reactive power into the grid by changing their inverter’s operating mode without considerable impact on their active power operation. This feature has created considerable opportunity for distribution network planners to explore if EVs could be used in the distribution network as reliable VAR suppliers. It may be possible for network operators to employ some EVs as VAR suppliers for future distribution grids. This paper proposes an innovative Smart Grid-based Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO) engine, capable of minimizing system power loss cost as well as the operating cost of switched Capacitor Banks, while optimizing the system voltage using an improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) with two levels of mutation and two levels of crossover. The paper studies the impact of EVs with different charging and penetration levels on VVO in different operating scenarios. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates how a typical VVO engine could benefit from V2G’s reactive power support. In order to assess V2G impacts on VVO and test the applicability of the proposed VVO, revised IEEE-123 Node Test Feeder in presence of various load types is used as case study.}

Interactive Video systems, which provide access to the content in video archives, are starting to emerge on the www. Partly due to the two-dimensional nature of the web, and partly due to the fact that images that comprise the video are two dimensional, most of these systems provide a VCR-like interface (play, fast-forward, reverse, etc., with additions like object selection, motion specification in the image space, and viewpoint selection). The basis of this paper is the realization that the video streams represent projections of a three-dimensional world, and the user is interested in this three-dimensional content and not the actual configuration of pixels in the image space. In this paper, we justify this intuition by enumerating the information-bearing entities that the user is interested in, and the information specification mechanisms that allow the user to query upon these entities. We will describe how such a intuitive system could be implemented using WWW technologies — VRML, HTML, and HTTP — and present our current WWW prototype which is based on extensions to some of these standards. This system is built on top of our multiple perspective interactive video (MPI Video) paradigm which provides a framework for the management of and interactive access to multiple streams of video data capturing different perspectives of related events.}

While various frameworks have been proposed for designing semantic web services (SWS), few of them aim at testing. Objective: This paper investigates into the technologies for automatically deriving test cases from semantic web service descriptions based on the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) framework. Method: WSMO goal specifications were translated into B abstract machines. Test cases were generated via model checking with calculated trap properties from coverage criteria. Furthermore, we employed mutation analysis to evaluate the test suite. In this approach, the model-based test case generation and code-based evaluation techniques are independent of each other, which provides much more accurate measures of the testing results. Results: We applied our approach to a real-world case study of the Amazon E-Commerce Service (ECS). The experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Conclusion: It is concluded that our approach is capable of automatically generating an effective set of test cases from the WSMO goal descriptions for SWS testing. The quality of test cases was measured in terms of their abilities to discover the injected faults at the code level. We implemented a tool to automate the steps for the mutation-based evaluation.}

Aneulysis supports the visual analysis of morphological and hemodynamic aneurysm information by providing different data processing and visualization modules that form an application. In this paper, we integrated a web-based module to analyze aneurysm data, which was designed and evaluated together with domain experts who confirmed its usefulness and clinical relevance. The web-based module supports the delivery of exploration results to people who do not have direct access to the entire database, such as experts at different locations, students or patients.

abstract = {Complex systems, like surgical robots, are designed by engineers. It is very difficult for them to determine the different needs and desires of all stakeholders. Especially when designed from scratch, end user input is essential in creating a system that has added value, is user friendly, and can be easily integrated into practice. For the development of a robotic flexible endoscope we have involved physicians, nurses, and equipment suppliers in our design approach. Seven steps are executed to convert user preferences and capabilities into concepts:•Determine focus area of development.•Create the current workflow of system application to understand (the context of) use.•Determine problem definition and design goal.•Create the future workflow, in which current problems are eliminated and major system wishes are fulfilled.•Translate the future workflow into a functional overview that contains system functions.•Select and configure the appropriate construction elements into physical overviews, being preliminary concepts.•Decompose physical overview into manageable modules. These views are evaluated by the major stakeholders and together form a system architecture. The system architecture helped us in defining the robotic modules required to fulfill all stakeholders‟ needs and desires. Demonstrators were built to evaluate critical concepts in clinical relevant experiments.}

However, the timing differences between cache hits and misses may lead to security vulnerabilities as they can be exploited by logical side channels. In this paper, we propose an innovative and coherent verification methodology to formally verifies cache designs against the potential existence of cache side channel vulnerabilities. Our methodology has been applied to three different cache models, i.e., a conventional cache, a static partitioned cache and a dynamic partitioned cache. The vulnerabilities of these caches have been evaluated using 28 different cache attack types. Results show that our proposed verification method can be applied successfully in verifying whether a cache is vulnerable to side channel attacks or not.}

abstract = {With the ever-increasing demand for personalized product functions, product structure becomes more and more complex. To design a complex engineering product, it involves mechanical, electrical, automation and other relevant fields, which requires a closer multidisciplinary collaborative design (MCD) and integration. However, the traditional design method lacks multidisciplinary coordination, which leads to interaction barriers between design stages and disconnection between product design and prototype manufacturing. To bridge the gap, a novel digital twin-enabled MCD approach is proposed. Firstly, the paper explores how to converge the MCD into the digital design process of complex engineering products in a cyber-physical system manner. The multidisciplinary collaborative design is divided into three parts: multidisciplinary knowledge collaboration, multidisciplinary collaborative modeling and multidisciplinary collaborative simulation, and the realization methods are proposed for each part. To be able to describe the complex product in a virtual environment, a systematic MCD framework based on the digital twin is further constructed. Integrate multidisciplinary collaboration into three stages: conceptual design, detailed design and virtual verification. The ability to verify and revise problems arising from multidisciplinary fusions in real-time minimizes the number of iterations and costs in the design process. Meanwhile, it provides a reference value for complex product design. Finally, a design case of an automatic cutting machine is conducted to reveal the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

We model the shaping of a pot as a gradual and progressive convergence of the pot-profile to the shape of the user׳s hand represented as a point-cloud (PCL). Our pottery-inspired application served as a platform for systematically revealing how users use their hands to express the intent of deformation during a pot shaping process. Our approach involved three stages: (a) clutching by proximal-attraction, (b) shaping by proximal-attraction, and (c) shaping by grasp+motion. The design and implementation of each stage was informed by user evaluations of the previous stage. Our work evidently demonstrates that it is possible to enable users to express their intent for shape deformation without the need for a fixed set of gestures for clutching and deforming a shape. We found that the expressive capability of hand articulation can be effectively harnessed for controllable shaping by organizing the deformation process in broad classes of intended operations such as pulling, pushing, and fairing. After minimal practice with the pottery application, users could figure out their own strategy for reaching, grasping, and deforming the pot. Users particularly enjoyed using day-to-day physical objects as tools for shaping pots.}

Despite the apparent potential of online health-promoting communities (OHPC), there is limited guidance available for developers on the basic design features that contribute to successful applications. The aim of this study was to develop a checklist for a pre-launch evaluation of OHPCs incorporating the perspectives of both the user and the health services communities.
Methods
The study was based on an action research design. Constructs previously applied to evaluate information system success were used as the basis for checklist development. The constructs were adapted for the OHPC context and formatively evaluated in a case study project. Evaluation data were collected from participatory observations and analyzed using qualitative methods.
Results
The initial OHPC checklist included the constructs information quality, service quality, and subjective norms. The contextual adaptation of the information quality construct resulted in items for content area, trust, and format; the adaptation of the service quality construct in items for staff competence, prompt service and empathy; and the adaptation of the subject norms construct in items for social facilitation, interconnectivity and communication. The formative evaluation demonstrated the critical need to balance the autonomy of the online community with the professional control of health services quality expressed in the information and service quality constructs.
Conclusions
A pre-launch OHPC evaluation checklist has been designed for use in practical development of health promotion web resources. Research on instruments for OHPC evaluations is warranted.}

Besides, no known empirical research has focused on exploring relationships between Digital Twin and mass individualization. Therefore, the principal objective of this study was to identify suitable Industry 4.0 technologies and a holistic reference architecture model to accomplish the most challenging Digital Twin enabled applications. In this study, a Digital Twin reference architecture was developed and applied in an industrial case. Also, Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) paradigm utilized for the digital transformation of unique wetlands with considerable advantages, including smart scheduled maintenance, real-time monitoring, remote controlling, and predicting functionalities.

abstract = {Preparing technical disclosure documents has always been a labor-intensive task in the site management practice of current OCS (Overhead Contact System) project construction, and the overall information level of construction management is not high. As a result, the technical disclosure documents are of poor quality, which significantly affects the effective play of technical documents in guiding construction activities. In view of the above limitations, this paper proposes a text-generation method for OCS engineering technical disclosure based on a knowledge element model. By investigating the characteristics of OCS engineering technical knowledge, a representation model is established to model the technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as case data, standard specifications, and design data. As OCS engineering is highly standardized, we propose a case-rule hybrid reasoning model for the reuse of OCS engineering case knowledge. The mining and utilization of earlier engineering technical knowledge are made possible by similar retrieval of precedent situations and adaptive rules modification. Finally, we suggest an automatic text-generating technique based on a configuration template for new building projects. The knowledge element model is converted into a technical disclosure document expressed in natural language using a two-level mapping process. The cantilever installation project is used as an illustration for empirical research, and relevant practitioners are invited to carry out a manual review by questionnaire from the perspectives of topic relevance, topic integrity, topic word implication, sentence smoothness, sentence continuity, and information volume. At the same time, standard assessment metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE are employed to compare with the neural network-based text generation approach. The outcomes demonstrate that the strategy suggested in this paper can generate technical disclosure text that performs well. Overall, its text integrity and readability may satisfy on-site management's demands and help on-site management lessen the workload of technical management staff.}

As one of the research communities focusing on very high quality digital content, CineGrid addresses these issues by building a global-scale distributed storage platform suitable for handling high quality digital media, which we call CineGrid Exchange (CX). Today, the CX connects seven universities and research laboratories in five countries, managing 400TB of storage, of which 250TB are dedicated to CineGrid. All of these sites are interconnected through a 10 Gbps dedicated optical network. The CX distributed repository holds digital motion pictures at HD, 2K and 4K resolutions, digital still images and digital audio in various formats. The goals of the CX are: (1) providing a 10 Gbps interconnected distributed platform for the CineGrid community to study digital content related issues, e.g., digital archiving, the movie production process, and network transfer/streaming protocols; (2) building a tool with which people can securely store, easily share and transfer very high definition digital content worldwide for exhibition and real-time collaboration; (3) automating digital policies through middleware and metadata management. In this publication, we introduce the architecture of the CX, resources managed by the CX and the implementation of the first series of CX management policies using the iRODS programmable middleware. We evaluate the first phase of CX platform implementation. We show that the CX has the potential to be a reliable and scalable digital management system.}

For small companies, the largest percentage of software companies in Mexico, they are fundamental for their growth and survival. However, academic programs do not always match industry requirements. In previous studies, the curricula in Computer Science and Informatics, and Software Engineering, of 4 Mexican universities, were compared with two software industry standards: the MoProSoft standard, a Mexican standard designed for organizations having up to 50 people and the Basic profile of the ISO/IEC 29110 developed specifically for organizations having up to 25 people. The analysis of the academic programs showed a better coverage of ISO/IEC 29110 than MoProSoft. In this paper, these two standards are mapped to understand the results of the analysis in detail and provide recommendations regarding academic programs. The analysis provides an evidence that the processes of the Basic profile of ISO/IEC 29110 are better covered by the universities curricula because the processes provides the minimal set of practices to be performed while a project is executed from the beginning until the delivery of a software. In addition, this mapping presents a clear differentiation between these two standards that might help Software Development Centers to understand where to start in the implementation of one of them.}

abstract = {The effectiveness of a system relates to its ability to fulfill its functional requirements. When a system consists of a set of collaborating agents, the overall performance may depend more on their ability to work together than on optimizing individual behavior. In fact, the goal of an agent is often at odds with the interest of the collective. The limitations of centralized control for complex systems suggest the need for decentralized coordination. This can be achieved by having each agent take explicit account of the cost of engaging in an activity as well as a measure of reward for effective behavior. The consideration of payoffs and penalties leads to an economic perspective of multiagent systems. In consequence, it is possible to draw on previous work in diverse fields, ranging from game theory to welfare economics and social policy. The promise and limitations of the explicit valuation approach are examined. To illustrate, the behavior of collaborative systems can be interpreted in terms of games of strategy; this approach permits a better understanding of the conditions for globally optimal behavior, as well as strategies for their attainment. The notions of agents and explicit valuation of action are versatile concepts. One indication of the versatility lies in the fact that these concepts cover as a special case the idea of genetic algorithms as a mechanism for learning systems.}

abstract = {Nowadays, mashups applications are growing in popularity. They are accessible by cross-device applications, supporting multiple forms of interaction in cloud environments. In general, mashups manage a huge amount of heterogeneous data from different sources and handle different kinds of users. In this respect, mashup User Interfaces are becoming one of the most important pieces in many kinds of current management systems, such as for certain geographic or environmental information systems working on the Internet. In this type of systems, the user interface plays a particular role due to the huge variety of components or apps that the users need to manage at the same time. However, currently, there has been scant attention paid to the management of the user’s interaction with mashups interfaces. This goal involves the need of having important, well-constructed tools and methods conducting the data acquisition process for managing properly: (a) the interaction over the mashup user interfaces, at the front-end side; (b) the storage of the interaction in relational databases; and (c) well-supported microservices structures handled in the cloud. The fact of having valuable and flexible data acquisition processes encourages the deployment of others important issues of the interaction management, i.e., data searching, data mining, marketing, security, accessibility, usability or traceability of interaction data, among others. In this article, we present a flexible Data Acquisition System capable of capturing the human-computer interactions performed by users over mashup (User) Interfaces with the aim of storing them in a relational database. Firstly, the morphology of traditional mashup applications, their specifications and the relevant information that surrounds an interaction have been studied. Thereupon, a data acquisition system that stores user interaction on mashup based on such specifications was constructed. To achieve that purpose, an architecture of microservices was also designed in the cloud to detect, acquire, and collect the interactions performed over this kind of interfaces. The whole process is ready for acquiring internal data of the information system as well as context information and location awareness. To validate the data acquisition system, some tests on empirical case studies have been developed. Efficiency and effectiveness have also been determined by evaluating the performance of the acquisition system during different load tests. Finally, in order to ensure the software quality, a continuous integration strategy for software development and an easy management of the code have been used, facilitating the software maintenance alongside the microservice architecture, where functionalities are well encapsulated.}

In this paper, we present an Intent-based deployment of a NFV orchestration stack that allows for the setup of Qos-aware and SDN-enabled network slices toward effective service chaining in the vertical domain. The main aim of the work is to simplify and automate the deployment of tenant-managed SDN-enabled network slices through a declarative approach while abstracting the underlying implementation details and unburdening verticals to deal with technology-specific low-level networking directives. In our approach, the intent-based framework we propose is based on an ETSI NFV MANO platform and is assessed through a set of experimental results demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.}

The architecture handles data locally on-site, lowers demand on radio access bandwidth, increases confidential data privacy, and continues the application execution even the network is disrupted. The architecture is open to redesign, reconfigure, and integrate with other computing paradigms. IoT-based m-learning use cases should be considered by reflecting learners' scaling of resource needs. Execution of complex use cases will expand the architecture base, MEC-based learning models usage, and change learning-teaching dynamics across educational disciplines.}

abstract = {A model called PM-Net for representing and monitoring the software development process is presented. This model provides information for progress management, as well as information of project status at different levels of detail, for the benefit of project managers. The model emphasizes bottom-up data collection and top-down information inquiry functions. The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) techniques are utilized for construction of a hierarchical structure of the software development process. This process can be viewed as a set of activities; each activity can be viewed as a set of subactivities, and each subactivity can be viewed as a set of tasks. Managers can make an inquiry regarding project progress information at process level, activity level, subactivity level or task level, depending on the degree of details they require. The manager can also change the control state operators at the lowest level of activity which will enable a transition for a change of process status at the upper-level activity. This ensures that any large-scale software development project based on PM-Net will be able to represent the most recent project progress status at any time in the project's running duration, so that managers can monitor the project progress more effectively.}

Among them, Mixed Interactive Systems (MIS), form a class of interactive systems that comprises augmented reality, tangible interfaces and ambient computing; MIS aim to take advantage of physical and digital worlds to promote a more transparent integration of interactive systems with the user’s environment. Due to the constant change of technologies and the multiplicity of these interaction forms, specific development approaches have been developed. As a result, numerous taxonomies, frameworks, API and models have emerged, each one covering a specific and limited aspect of the development of MIS. To support a coherent use of these multiple development resources and contribute to the increasing popularity of MIS, we have developed a framework based on Model-Driven Engineering. The goal is to take advantage of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) standards, methodology and tools to support the manipulation of complementary Domain Specific Languages (DSL), to organize and link the use of different design and implementation resources, and to ensure a rationalized implementation based on design choices. In this paper, we first summarize existing uses of MDE in HCI before focusing on five major benefits MDE can provide in a MIS development context. We then detail which MDE tools and resources support these benefits and thus form the pillars of the success of an MDE-based MIS development approach. Based on this analysis, we introduce our framework, called Guide-Me, and illustrate its use through a case study. This framework includes two design models. Model transformations are also included to link one model to another; as a result the frameworks coverage extends from the earliest design step to a software component-based prototyping platform. A toolset based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) that supports the use of the framework is also presented. We finally assess our MDE-based development process for MIS based on the five major MDE benefits for MIS.}

abstract = {In recent years, edge computing and Information Centric Networking (ICN) have been introduced as emerging technologies for distributing content closer to the end users. The former promises to increase the performance of several applications by using data locality and relieve the core network by addressing the increasing bandwidth demands caused by increased data volume. The latter makes the content directly addressable and routable in the network. Enabling ICN with edge computing in Radio Access Network (RAN) can improve the efficiency of content distribution and communication performance by reducing the distance between users and services. In line with this assertion, in this paper, we propose an ICN-capable RAN architecture for 5G edge computing environments that offers device to device communication and ICN application layer support at base stations. Moreover, ICN and edge caching is only useful for static content-requests for dynamic content have to traverse the core network increasing the latency in 5G networks. To address this issue, we provide a content prefetching strategy based on ICN naming. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme results in high cache hit ratios and lower delays compared to conventional edge systems and prior work on ICN for 5G.}

abstract = {Background
Medication discrepancies, which are a threat to patient safety, can be reduced by medication reconciliation (MedRec). MedRec is a complex process that can be supported by the use of information technology and patient engagement. Therefore, the SEAMPAT project aims to develop a MedRec IT platform based on two applications. The application for the professionals is called: the “MedRec app”.
Objective
In the present study, we aimed to describe the development and usability testing of the MedRec app, reporting results of a three iterations user-centered usability evaluation.
Methods
We used a three phase iterative user-centered study spread over 16 months. At each phase, the usability evaluation included several methods (observations, questionnaires, and follow-up discussions with participants) to collect quantitative and qualitative data in order to improve the current prototype and evolve to the next prototype.
Results
In total, 48 healthcare professionals (25 general practitioners and 23 hospital clinicians) participated to the MedRec app evaluation. There were 14, 32 and 5 participants for phases 1, 2 and 3 respectively. At each phase, many design modifications were done to strengthen usability. Concerning usability, participants considered the prototypes as an acceptable interface with a median System Usability Score of 73 at phase 2 and 75 at phase 3. Participants emphasized the need for improvements concerning workflow integration, usefulness and interoperability.
Conclusion
The MedRec app was perceived as being useful, usable and satisfying. However, further improvements are required in several usability aspects. Our study demonstrates the importance of conducting usability assessments before investing time and resources in a large study evaluating the effect of an eMedRec approach on clinical outcomes. Our findings may also increase the chances of acceptability and sustained use over time by clinicians.}

Thus, an accurate and prompt analysis of customer requirements (CRs) in the early design stage is critical to its success. However, most OKP companies are small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Due to the limited resources and low product planning budget, they often cannot obtain abundant CR information nor can they afford the expense of complicated planning process. To address these issues, a system framework is proposed in support of OKP product planning process in a cloud-based design (CBD) environment. The challenges and future market niches of OKP companies are presented. The comparison of typical distributed systems shows that CBD, which utilizes advanced information technologies and business model, has advantages in providing sufficient resources, decreasing product development time span for OKP companies in a cost-efficient way. This article describes the proposed system architecture, the business interaction process and the information communication among customers, designers and marketing analysts at the product planning stage. To validate the proposed framework, a prototype system module MyProduct is under development in the CBD environment with an illustrative example.}

However, the ancient buildings present in these sites are commonly found in an advanced state of degradation which difficult the professional/expert analysis. Virtual reconstructions of such buildings aim to provide a digital insight of how these historical places could have been in ancient times. Moreover, the visualization of such models has been explored by some Augmented Reality (AR) systems capable of providing support to experts. Their compelling and appealing environments have also been applied to promote the social and cultural participation of general public. The existing AR solutions regarding this thematic rarely explore the potential of realism, due to the following lacks: the exploration of mixed environments is usually only supported for indoors or outdoors, not both in the same system; the adaptation of the illumination conditions to the reconstructed structures is rarely addressed causing a decrease of credibility. MixAR [1] is a system concerned with those challenges, aiming to provide the visualization of virtual buildings augmented upon real ruins, allowing soft transitions among its interiors and exteriors and using relighting techniques for a faithful interior illumination, while the user freely moves in a given cultural heritage site, carrying a mobile unit. Regarding the focus of this paper, we intend to report the current state of MixAR mobile unit prototype, which allows visualizing virtual buildings – properly aligned with real-world structures – based on user's location, during outdoor navigation. In order to evaluate the prototype performance, a set of tests were made using virtual models with different complexities.}

There are a number of hypermedia/web engineering methods that provide mechanisms to specify the product requirements, including those concerning structure, navigation, interaction, presentation and access. But apart from product requirements there are also process requirements which in the web arena are constantly changing. Hence, to be put in practice without disturbing the project goals nor compromising its success, methods have to rely on empirical and flexible process models that can be easily adapted to fit process requirements. Little attention has been paid to the process model in most hypermedia/web methods which usually apply a classical iterative process based on the use of prototypes that are tested with users. In this paper we describe how we did apply the ADM web engineering method following a flexible star life cycle in the context of a specific web project highlighting the main benefits of this approach. In particular we will describe the different cycles applied in the ARCE project, illustrating the application of a usability engineering life cycle in a real case.}

The realization of such high data rates is unlikely with the currently licensed bands in the spectrum. Therefore, it is clear that such high rates could only be achieved by employing more bandwidth with the state-of-the-art technology. Considering the fact that bands in the range of 275GHz–3000GHz, which are known as Terahertz (THz) bands, are not yet allocated for specific active services around the globe, there can be a true potential to achieve the desired data rates at THz bands. However, due to the characteristics of these bands, there are many open issues in terms of THz radio communication system design. In this study, open issues and the state-of-the-art solutions to these issues for THz communication system design are discussed. Moreover, standardization efforts up to date are elaborated. This study concludes that the actual implementation of fully operational THz communication systems obliges to carry out a multi-disciplinary effort including statistical propagation and channel characterizations, adaptive transceiver designs (including both baseband and radio frequency (RF) front-end portions), reconfigurable platforms, advanced signal processing algorithms and techniques along with upper layer protocols equipped with various security and privacy levels.}

The research is based on the analysis of a visual–haptic-based simulator targeted to maintenance activity training for aerospace industry which is taken as a case study. As a result, we propose a novel framework able to collect and then process relevant interaction data during the execution of haptic tasks, enabling to analyze dependability vs. usability correlations.}

abstract = {Context
When playing a co-operative game, being aware of your collaborators (where they are playing, what they are doing, the abilities they have, etc.) is essential for achieving the game's goals. This led to the definition of Gamespace Awareness in order to guide in the identification of the awareness needs in the form of a compilation of the awareness elements that a co-operative game should feature.
Objective
Gamespace Awareness does not establish how much awareness information players must be provided with. This constitutes the main motivation for this work: to assess the impact of different levels of Gamespace Awareness elements on a co-operative game.
Method
A multiplayer action game was developed that supports three different awareness configurations, each one featuring different awareness levels (high, medium and low). The impact of these awareness levels was measured as regards game score, time, players’ happiness while playing, enjoyment and perceived usefulness. Several techniques such as subjective surveys and facial expression analysis were used to measure these factors.
Results
The analysis of the results shows that the higher the awareness, the better the game score. However, the highest level of player happiness was not achieved with the most awareness-enabled configuration; we found that the players’ enjoyment depends not only on their awareness level but also on their expertise level. Finally, the awareness elements related to the present and the future were the most useful, as could be expected in a multiplayer action game.
Conclusions
The results showed that the medium level awareness obtained the best results. We therefore concluded that a certain level of awareness is necessary, but that excessive awareness could negatively affect the game experience.}

abstract = {Improving existing schemes based on performance goals can have a significant impact on the final product. During the conceptual design stage, the design information is limited and non-numerical, and thus, refinement cannot be performed via existing numerical algorithms. In addition, a conceptual scheme is formed by combining the appropriate principle solutions for different subfunctions, and different principle solutions can achieve different degrees of subsequent product performance satisfaction. Therefore, obtaining an improved principle solution with the maximum performance value is a critical issue that should be solved via conceptual scheme improvement. This paper proposes the concept of the performance value of the principle solution, and a scheme is improved based on the proposed concept. First, a performance feature model is constructed to analyze the different types of performance information required by the core subfunctions. Second, a correlation matrix composed of the performance and subfunctions is built. Third, a knowledge representation model is defined to analyze the performance knowledge associated with each principle solution; then, a correlation matrix of the principle solution and performance is built. Finally, performance is employed as the correlation factor, and the two matrices are multiplied to obtain a performance value matrix that represents the performance satisfaction degree of the principle solutions of each subfunction. A principle solution with a high performance value is selected to improve the current principle solution. Based on the above analysis process, a prototype conceptual design scheme improvement solution system (CDSIS system) is developed to assist in obtaining new principle solutions for a coal mining machine, and scheme improvement is preliminarily achieved.}

However, traditional simulation tools generally emphasize discipline-oriented purposes and centralized running, and cannot adequately support the collaborative simulation in a distributed environment. Although some tools have been developed to enable remote access to simulations, most of them focus on the sharing of information and the provision of simulations via a single and centralized program. The long-term aim of this research is to develop a collaborative modeling and simulation platform, which will provide an integrated environment for multi-disciplinary teams to create, share, and integrate simulation services on the Internet. A step towards such a platform is described which includes the infrastructures for distributed communication, the mechanism for run-time interaction, and the representation of a simulation system at the abstract level. In this paper, we will (1) formulate a collaborative simulation problem; (2) identify the factors influencing the performance of a simulation; (3) propose a method for run-time interaction to achieve optimal simulation accuracy; and (4) illustrate how the components serving different purposes are integrated. A case study is described, based on a prototype implementation of the proposed solution, to explore supporting collaborative simulation in an Internet-distributed environment.}

abstract = {Remote Procedure Call (RPC) has become a popular paradigm for distributed application development in a client-server environment. It is simple, flexible and powerful. Most of the RPC mechanisms today are synchronous in nature, and hence fail to exploit fully the parallelism inherent in distributed applications. The authors have designed and implemented a transport independent asynchronous RPC mechanism (ASTRA) that combines the advantages of both RPC and the message-passing IPC. ASTRA calls do not block the caller (client) and the replies can be received as and when they are needed, thus allowing the client execution to proceed locally in parallel with the server invocation. All the calls are received and executed by the server in the order called by the client. ASTRA is unique among other asynchronous RPC systems in allowing its users to explicitly specify whether low-latency or high-throughput is required for a call. This paper describes the ASTRA primitives and a client-server based application developed using ASTRA. The performance results of the application are briefly summarized to show the suitability of ASTRA for distributed application development.}

In this work, we firstly surveyed the typical narrative frameworks of DT modelling: generalized layered method, decomposition and composition method, Asset Administration Shell framework, and standardized architecture. Secondly, the Petri nets-based digital twin framework for the robotic dual-arm cooperative system was presented in detail through the domain-based and entity-based systematization methodology. The proposed framework generated a conceptually embodied and situated DT environment, which not only represented the highly hybrid nature (i.e., continuous, discrete and cooperative) of the dual-arm cooperative operation process, but also avoided the complex decoupling calculation of closed kinematic chains in the bi-manual manipulation of industrial arms. Furthermore, two digital twin instances clearly demonstrated that the holonic integration of operational technologies equipment, information technologies and DT through the industrial internet of things manifested a game-changing potential to upgrade the capability of an existing brownfield CPS to perform complex tasks. Concluding, by coupling the discrete event simulation at the highly abstract level and the 3D offline programming simulation in the intuitively DT environment, this comprehensive practice of DT to transform the loose DT metaphor into strictly industrial domains provided an illuminating cross-increment for both the robotic community and the DT facilitators.}

Furthermore, quality assurance is a key domain in manufacturing that uses almost all the industry 4.0 technologies and has great impact on the sustainability of a manufacturing systems. The latest approach to higher quality and manufacturing sustainability is named Zero Defect Manufacturing (ZDM). ZDM interest has spiked the last three years illustrating the need for an alternative quality assurance approach from the traditional such as Six Sigma and Lean manufacturing. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to create a ZDM ontology that can semantically align multiple software systems that interact in a ZDM ecosystem. The development of the proposed ZDM ontology was performed using the principles introduced by Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) and with the use of Basic formal ontology (BFO) as an upper level ontology. The proposed ontology was utilized in the Prediction Optimization Designer tool developed, to assist developers to create new projects reusing existing resources, or to respond to a specific challenge. The use case validation results show that the combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Sentence-BERT and ontology-based search methods rooted in the ZDM ontology is a promising strategy to implement effective search engines for applications in the ZDM domain.}

The aim of the paper is twofold. First, we present Starviewer, a DICOM viewer developed in C++ with a core component built on top of open-source libraries. The viewer supports extensions that implement functionalities and front-ends for specific use cases. Second, we propose an adaptable evaluation framework based on a set of criteria weighted according to user needs. The framework can consider different user profiles and allow criteria to be decomposed in subcriteria and grouped in more general categories making a multi-level hierarchical structure that can be analysed at different levels of detail to make scores interpretation more comprehensible.
Results
Different examples to illustrate Starviewer functionalities and its extensions are presented. In addition, the proposed evaluation framework is used to compare Starviewer with four open-source viewers regarding their functionalities for daily clinical practice. In a range from 0 to 10, the final scores are: Horos (7.7), Starviewer (6.2), Weasis (6.0), Ginkgo CADx (4.1), and medInria (3.8).
Conclusions
Starviewer provides basic and advanced features for daily image diagnosis needs as well as a modular design that enables the development of custom extensions. The evaluation framework is useful to understand and prioritize new development goals, and can be easily adapted to express different needs by altering the weights. Moreover, it can be used as a complement to maturity models.}

The GEYSERS testbed is composed of a set of local physical testbeds allocated in the facilities of the GEYSERS partners. It is built up based on the requirements specification, architecture definition and per-layer development that constitutes the whole GEYSERS ecosystem, and validates the procedures on the GEYSERS prototypes. The testbed includes optical devices (layer 1), switches (layer 2), and IT resources deployed in different local testbeds provided by the project partners and interconnected among them to compose the whole testbed layout. The main goal of the GEYSERS testbed is twofold. On one hand, it aims at providing a validation ground for the architecture, concepts and business models proposed by GEYSERS, sustained by two main paradigms: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and the coupled provisioning of optical network and IT resources. On the other hand, it is used as a demonstration platform for testing the software prototypes within the project and to demonstrate to the research and business community the project approach and solutions. In this work, we discuss our experience in the deployment of the testbed and share the results and insights learned from our trials in the process. Additionally, the paper highlights the most relevant experiments carried out in the testbed, aimed at the validation of the overall GEYSERS architecture.}

Moreover, the minor variations within the commonality should also be modeled and reflected in the design of components so that family members can effectively customize the components for their own purpose. To carry out domain analysis effectively and design widely reusable components, precise definitions of variability-related terms and a classification of variability types must be made. In this paper, we identify the fundamental difference between conventional variability and component variability, and present five types of variability and three kinds of variability scopes. Each type of variability is precisely defined for its applicable situations and guidelines. Having a formal view on variability, not only the domain analysis but also component customization can be effectively carried out in a precise manner.}

The aim of this work is to design and build methodologically, throughout ontological engineering, the ON-SMMILE model to be used as support of future works closely linked to supervision of student's learning as competence-based recommender system. For this purpose, our model is designed as a set of ontological resources that have been extended, standardized, interrelated and adapted to be used in multiple learning environments. In this paper, we also analyze the available approaches based on instructional design which can be added to ontology network to build the proposed model. As a case study, a chemical experiment in a virtual environment and its instantiation are described in terms of ON-SMMILE.}

abstract = {The design and development of a Product–Service System (PSS) raises new issues since the service component introduces further requirements than traditional product engineering. Compared to physical products, services are generally under-designed and inefficiently developed. For this reason, approaches such as New Service Development, Service Design and Service Engineering have emerged during the years to support the design and development of service either as a system itself or as a constituting element of a Product–Service System. However, only Service Engineering investigates service design and development with a systematic perspective and with a seamless integration of product and service contents. The purpose of this paper is to provide a holistic conceptualisation and an up-to-date review of the literature on Service Engineering with a specific focus on its adoption in the PSS context. A critical analysis is also performed with the aim to define a research agenda and the most prominent key actions that could give directions for future research.}

abstract = {Product complexity increases along with the increase of product functions. Effective methods are required in the complex product development. Axiomatic design can effectively reduce product complexity, but there are deficiencies in the usage process and the innovation stimulation. This paper proposes a holistic method for the development of complex products by using a neural network-aided technological evolution process to control negative effects of complexity. For the first time, engineering parameters are used as the intermediary between the complexity and technological evolution. Problematic engineering parameters are extracted from a current reality tree model through a natural language process. An artificial neural network is trained to predict the technological evolution law based on existing successful samples. Appropriate analogical objects are formed in an invention principle case library through the similarity analysis of engineering parameters. The optimal scheme is developed objectively by using the coefficient variation method and Dempster combination rule. The proposed method is applied to develop a pipe cutting machine with a granted patent for its feasibility and effectiveness.}

abstract = {Recursive subdivision on an initial control mesh generates a visually pleasing smooth surface in the limit. Nevertheless, users must carefully specify the initial mesh and/or painstakingly manipulate the control vertices at different levels of subdivision hierarchy to satisfy a diverse set of functional requirements and aesthetic criteria in the limit shape. This modeling drawback results from the lack of direct manipulation tools for the limit geometric shape. To improve the efficiency of interactive geometric modeling and engineering design, in this paper we integrate novel physics-based modeling techniques with powerful geometric subdivision principles, and develop a unified finite element method (FEM)-based methodology for arbitrary subdivision schemes. Strongly inspired by the recent research on Dynamic Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (D-NURBS), we formulate and develop a dynamic framework that permits users to directly manipulate the limit surface obtained from any subdivision procedure via simulated “force” tools. The most significant contribution of our unified approach is the formulation of the limit surface of an arbitrary subdivision scheme as being composed of a single type of novel finite element. The specific geometric and dynamic features of our subdivision-based finite elements depend on the subdivision scheme used. We present our novel FEM for the modified butterfly and Catmull–Clark subdivision schemes, and generalize our dynamic framework to be applicable to other subdivision schemes. Our FEM-based approach significantly advances the state-of-the-art in physics-based geometric modeling since it provides a universal physics-based framework for any subdivision scheme. In addition, we systematically devise a mechanism that allows users to directly (not via control meshes) deform any subdivision surface; finally, we represent the limit surface of any subdivision scheme using a collection of subdivision-based novel finite elements. Our experiments demonstrate that the new unified FEM-based framework not only promises a greater potential for subdivision techniques in solid modeling, finite element analysis, and engineering design, but that it will further foster the applicability of subdivision geometry in a wide range of visual computing applications such as visualization, virtual reality, computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, and medical imaging as well.}

This is mainly true in industries like automotive, aeronautic, or NC machines tools. Therefore, it is crucial to predict these characteristics as soon as possible before the manufacturing starts. This paper presents an approach to provide indicators for maintainability and safety prediction at early stage of design. The assessment procedure uses the product CAD 3D model and an associated semantic matrix gathering information on the product components criticality and reliability. Using this information we calculate indicators for the product maintainability and safety. An academic application is developed to illustrate our approach and point out the interaction between maintainability and safety constraints to determine suitable solution. In conclusion, we state on possible extensions of this approach for evaluating other product lifecycle characteristics and we give guidelines on the implementation aspects.}

Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) devices and legacy subsystems cooperate while orchestrated by a manager in charge of enforcing a distributed logic.

In addition, new application oriented objects such as shop floor, manufacturing line, welding station, robots, and cells have been introduced in the middleware. The combination of such objects and previous modules offers a new and flexible industry oriented middleware. A second contribution is in the form of traffic analysis conducted at the floor level.

The prediction is done with the help of the Advanced Neural network which is incorporated with Hybrid Cuckoo search (HCS) optimization algorithm for better prediction accuracy. The application software is first subjected to test case generation and once the test cases are generated they are applied to advanced neural network for the prediction of quality. The neural network is improved by utilizing HCS which optimizes the weight factor for improving the prediction.

A large scale international study has identified mental illnesses as the second leading cause of disability and premature mortality in the developed world [Murray, C.L., Lopez, A.D. (Eds.), 1996. The Global Burden of Disease: A comprehensive assessment of mortality and disability from disease, injuries, and risk factors in 1990 and projected to 2020. Harvard University, Cambridge, MA]. Unfortunately, research also suggests that the majority of people suffering from treatable mental health disorders do not have access to the required treatment. Furthermore, even when treatment is accessible many sufferers are unable to successfully engage with professional services [Surgeon General, 1999. Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General – Executive Summary, Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC, Retrieved August 2006, from http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/home.html; WHO World Mental Health Survey Consortium, 2004. Prevalence, severity, and unmet need for treatment of mental disorders in the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys. Journal of the American Medical Association, 291(21)]. Computer assisted mental health interventions have the potential to help in addressing this imbalance. However, a review of literature shows that to date this potential has been largely unexplored. One of the primary reasons for this is that few researchers from a HCI or technical background have engaged in this area. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology for talk-based mental health interventions. Theoretical approaches to the treatment of mental illness are reviewed, as is previous research on the use of technology in this area. Several significant factors effecting design and evaluation are identified and based on these factors a broad set of design guidelines are proposed to aid the development of new technologies. Of the issues identified, ethical requirements along with the sensitivity and stigma associated with mental illness pose particular challenges to HCI professionals. These factors place strict limitations on access to mental health care (MHC) settings by non-MHC professionals and create difficulties for the direct application of traditional HCI methods, such as participatory, user-centred and iterative design. To overcome these difficulties this paper proposes a model for collaborative design and evaluation, involving both HCI and MHC professionals. The development of adaptable technologies is an important element of the proposed approach. The final contribution of the paper is to suggest future research directions and identify ways in which HCI researchers can contribute to this work.}

Thus, it is important that these games are able to promote players enjoyment, encouraging replayability and recommendation from players, potentially enhancing the games’ educational effects. From the association of criteria found in GameFlow and EGameFlow models with design elements of digital games, this paper presents design requirements for the development with focus on players’ enjoyment. These design requirements objectively present how elements can be implemented in educational serious games to enhance the achievement of criteria for player enjoyment found in those models. The design requirements were applied in the development a game, later evaluated using the GameFlow and EGameFlow models. The results revealed positive feedback in regards to player enjoyment, evidencing the effectiveness of the design requirements.

The idea behind this approach is to incorporate the characteristic of reusability into the greenhouse design process: this characteristic naturally reduces the cost of design of new programs, since the design costs are measured in time and the number of errors made and rectified. In this paper, we demonstrate modeling using object-oriented techniques (OOT) based upon standard UML and XML notations for simulating multitunnel greenhouses. These techniques facilitate identification of the actors involved, their roles, functions, interaction protocols and behavior. Some examples include the processes of greenhouse marketing, calculation of interdependencies and decomposition between the greenhouse structures.}

In their previous work, the authors of the paper examined variations of primitive solids to create a means of representing geometric tolerances in a solid modeller. The paper examines the intersection of two cylinders with reference to the parametric tolerance zones that are associated with size, position and orientation tolerances. Intersection surface areas and volumes are examined. This information can be used not only in the building of models with Boolean operations on primitives, but also in the checking of the interference between mating parts which can arise in fittings of various sorts and functional tolerancing. Because of the likely computer implementation of surface-area or volume calculations relating to the intersection of primitives, the inclusion of faceted solids and methods of dealing with solid primitives are considered. The intersection of two cylinders of arbitrary radii at an arbitrary angle, in a complex steam-trap and flash-tank pipe network, is imaged.}

Optimal placement of the end devices to the most suitable access network is expected to provide the best Quality of Service (QoS) experience to the users but also the maximum utilization of the scarce wireless resources by the operators. Several on-going proposals attempt to overcome the existing barriers by enabling the use of Wi-Fis and femto-cells to cater for part of the load generated by the end devices. The evolution of the Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) for the core part of the cellular network, as well as the Hotspot 2.0 approach, are currently being subject to thorough discussions and studies and are expected to facilitate a seamless 3GPP-WiFi interworking. During the past years, several Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection schemes have been proposed. However, these schemes do not take into consideration the opportunities offered by these new standardized approaches. Our paper acts in a manifold way: Firstly, it proposes COmpAsS, a Context-Aware RAT Selection mechanism, the main part of which operates on the User Equipment (UE)-side, minimizing signaling overhead over the air interface and computation load on the base stations. Secondly, we discuss in detail the architectural perspective; i.e., the extensions needed in the network interfaces that enable the exchange of the required context information among the respective network entities and in accordance with the 3GPP trends in relation to the context-aggregating entities. Furthermore, we quantify the signaling overhead of the proposed mechanism by linking it to the current 3GPP specifications and performing a comprehensive per-parameter analysis. Finally, we evaluate the novel scheme via extensive simulations in a complex and realistic 5G use case, illustrating the clear advantages of our approach in terms of key QoS metrics, i.e. the user-experienced throughput and delay, both in the uplink and the downlink.}

abstract = {Context
In recent years, architectural design decisions are becoming more and more common for documenting software architectures. Rather than describing the structure of software systems, architectural decisions capture the design rationale and – often reusable – architectural knowledge. Many approaches and tools have been proposed in the literature to support architectural decision making and documentation (for instance, based on models, ontologies, or templates). In this context, the capturing, organization, and effective reuse of architectural knowledge has gained a lot of attention.
Objective
However, there is little empirical evidence about the supportive effect of reusable architectural knowledge on the effectiveness and efficiency of architectural decision making.
Method
To investigate these aspects, we conducted two separate controlled experiments with software architecture students in which we tested the supportive effect of reusable decision models in decision making and documentation.
Results
Our results show that the use of reusable decision models can significantly increase both the efficiency and the effectiveness of novice architects.
Conclusion
We can report, that our findings are in line with similar studies and support the claims regarding reusable architectural design decisions in principle.}

Current and emerging developments in mobile computing integrated with developments in pervasive agent technologies such as mobile agent will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems. In this paper we present the design and architecture of a mobile multi-agent based information platform – MADIP – to support the intensive and distributed nature of wide-area (e.g., national or metropolitan) monitoring environment. To exemplify the proposed methodology, an e-health monitoring environment was built on top of MADIP as an illustration. Aglets Software Development Kit (ASDK) was adopted for prototyping, concept-proofing, and evaluation. By integrating the proposed platform with light-weight, portable monitoring devices (e.g., portable vital sign monitor), continuous long-term health monitoring can be performed without interfering with the patients’ everyday activities and without restricting their mobility. The optimal utilization of medical resources can be also achieved.}

Compared with the traditional product service, the SPS have more complicated interactions between the service components due to the novel characteristics caused by the application of smart technologies. The SPS modularization presents great differences from the identification of service component, correlation evaluation and module partition with the traditional product service modularization. However, most the existing research mainly focuses on the context of traditional product service, while containing scant study of smart product service. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid framework for SPS modularization. In the framework, a cyber-physical product service blueprint is firstly proposed to represent the SPS operation process and identify the SPS components. Then, a rough-fuzzy correlation matrix is presented to determine the comprehensive interdependence between all pairs of SPS components with fully considering the hybrid decision uncertainties involved in the evaluation process, i.e., intrapersonal linguistic vagueness and interpersonal preference diversity. After that, the complex network theory is used to construct the SPS network and a modified Girvan-Newman algorithm is adopted for the SPS module partition. Finally, an illustrative modularization case of smart gearbox maintenance service and some caparisons with other methods demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach.}

Finally we present an outline vision for such a system, supported by a generic system architecture and a simple business model for its deployment, noting opportunities for future work in its realisation.}

In the first part, on-line freehand sketched input is interpreted as 2D and 3D geometry, which geometrically represents conceptual design. The system then infers 3D configuration by analysing 3D modelling history. The configuration is described by a parent–child hierarchical relationship and relative positions between two geometric components. The positioning information is computed with respect to the VRML97 specification. In order to verify the conceptual design of a product, the behaviours can be specified interactively on different components. Finally, the system creates VRML97 formatted files for behavioural simulation and collaborative design application over the Internet. The paper gives examples of web-based applications.

This paper analyses the potentials and develops general procedures for on-the-go data acquisition of soil sensors. The methods and procedures used to manage data with respect to a farm management information system (FMIS) are described. The current data communication standard for tractors and machinery in agriculture is ISO 11783, which is rather well established and has gained market acceptance. However, there are a significant number of non-ISO 11783 compliant sensors in practice. Thus, two concepts are proposed. The first concept is on-the-go data collection based on ISO 11783, which mostly covers data on parameters related to tractor and machine performance, e.g. speed, draught, fuel consumption, etc. Process data from sensors with Control Area Network (CAN) interfaces is converted into ISO 11783 XML and then imported into relational database at FMIS using RelaXML tool. There is also the export function from database to task controller (TC) to provide task management, as described in ISO 11783:10. The second concept is on-the-go data collection with non-ISO 11783 sensors. This data is likely to be recorded in many formats, which require an import service. An import service is based on local or public sharing or semantic mapping outputting a common format for FMIS (e.g. AgroXML). Import is best performed as close to the generation of sensor data as possible to maximise the availability of metadata. A case study of sensor based variable rate fertilisation (VRF) has been undertaken focussing on German fertilisation rules.}

However, there are two major omissions in existing work: firstly, a unified framework in the process of product conceptualization has not been well addressed; and secondly, it is imperative to attain an effective data-mining approach to support the product conceptualization process. Based on this understanding, the proposed approach aims at postulating an axiomatic product conceptualization system (APCS) to meet the demand of product concept development. The proposed APCS comprises three cohesively interacting modules, namely, knowledge elicitation module using laddering technique; knowledge representation module using design knowledge hierarchy (DKH); and knowledge synthesis module using restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) neural network. Accordingly, this system offers a method of making design decisions via a web-based data-mining product conceptualization approach. A case study on wood golf club design has been used for system illustration.}

In this paper we describe part of the advanced diagnosis and measurement selection capabilities of the model-based diagnosis tool VHDLDIAG designed for (semi)automatically locating bugs in VHDL programs. VHDL is an Ada-like and widely used hardware description language. VHDL programs are converted into logical descriptions which are then used by a diagnosis engine for detecting the parts of the program responsible for an observed misbehavior. The results of diagnosis, i.e. the malfunctioning program fragments, are mapped back to the program code. Because of the logical description used VHDLDIAG can be applied to a wide range of programs from small to very large ones with up to thousands of MBytes of source code. This paper presents techniques which use multiple versions of a design in diagnosis, as well as the measurement selection process used in VHDLDIAG. Formal definitions and performance results using real-world VHDL programs are given.}

The consideration of adaptability in designing such systems is necessary in this unstable and volatile environment. There have been intensive efforts on solutions to make service compositions adaptable, but little attention is given to the evaluation of such adaptability. This paper proposes a set of metrics to quantify the adaptability of service compositions that are specified from the adaptive WS-BPEL-based frameworks. The metrics are based on two adaptability dimensions: the structure and binding variabilities. Structure variability, enables runtime changes to the composition workflow while binding variability, allows dynamic binding to concrete partner services. We evaluate the metrics through a case study, utilising variants of a travel booking process specified from different adaptive WS-BPEL-based frameworks found in the literature. The metrics are applicable to a wide spectrum of adaptive service compositions and their frameworks. A support tool is also developed to automate metrics computation. Through the metrics, adaptability of service compositions and their frameworks can be assessed and compared. This would facilitate design decisions in building flexible and robust services where adaptability is a first class concern.}

These artifacts are made by combining existing elements (legacy) and by building new subsystems without explicit and comprehensive up-front coordination. To a large extent, these complex systems emerge and evolve. Experience shows that designers frequently fail to develop artifacts that, when combined, facilitate the emergence of effective and efficient systems. This paper formally elaborates the mechanism behind this phenomenon, and proposes principles for the design of components for emergent systems. The above insights were gained during the development of research prototypes for multi-agent manufacturing control; manufacturing systems are notorious for experiencing integration and interoperability problems as described above. Consequently, the design principles are discussed and illustrated on the design of multi-agent manufacturing control systems but also on work by others. Finally, although this paper mainly discusses the above in a generic fashion, and although the generic statements hold in an application-independent manner, it is important to appreciate that the applicability of the above insights and principles has significant limitations, which are discussed in the paper.}

Real estate online platforms (REOPs) are getting more attention in the era of COVID-19, where the real estate businesses must run online, and the service users are pushed to a forced digital experience adoption. The users or consumers are not satisfied or happy with the current state of REOPs and often regret their decisions due to the poor quality of the web-based information provided on these REOPs. Based on a mixed approach of integrated KANO-SISQual, the current study develops a comprehensive smart real estate technology adoption model (SRETAM) to model the users’ perception of the REOPs in DDE. Data is collected through a questionnaire survey from 407 Sydney based REOP users. A total of 31 key factors are identified by reviewing 256 articles vetted by 12 local real estate agents. The results highlight 19 factors to be very important to REOPs users: reliability, the accuracy of the information, and credibility of the online platforms are the top three important factors. The hypotheses’ results show that all the SRETAM categories contribute equally to the users’ behavioural intention to use the REOPs and the KANO categories are statistically different. For KANO categories, eight attractive features are identified: graphical statistics, familiar web technology, content structure, web design, immersive content, self-efficacy, information novelty, and presence of 3D interactive models. Displaying the users’ location, learning tutorials, and hyperlinks to external sources on the web portals dissatisfy REOP users. The factors and their classifications can help the users get more features, verified, and transparent information for making better decisions in the DDE, whereas the REOP can enjoy more business due to increased service consumers. This can lay the foundation for transforming the traditional real estate sector into smart real estate in lines with industry 4.0 requirements in the DDE.}

Due to the relatively large data volume of terminal devices in the edge computing network, how to process the upstream data stream and efficiently and accurately realize the wireless data monitoring transmission is a problem that the edge server needs to solve. This paper analyzes the interaction and cooperation relationship between levels, proposes a scheduling model and storage strategy for uplink data flow, and uses data flow scheduling and data flow hierarchical storage algorithms to optimize the edge system of data flow scheduling and storage. Combined with the attributes of the edge computing network system, the measurement indicators of the scheduling and storage of the terminal uplink data flow in the edge computing network are modeled and analyzed. We analyze the processing time delay, cost, and optimization target for optimizing the data transmission task. The simulation experiments prove that the algorithm in this paper has advantages in solving data transmission and storage problems in the network. It can reduce costs and delays, increase throughput, ensure monitoring node access delays, and maintain edge servers and disaster monitoring data centers.}

abstract = {The paper presents computer-aided methods that allocate a dental implant and suggest its size, during the pre-operative planning stage, in conformance with introduced optimization criteria and established clinical requirements. Based on computed tomography data of the jaw and prosthesis anatomy, single tooth cases are planned for the best-suited implant insertion at a user-defined region. An optimum implantation axis line is produced and cylindrical implants of various candidate sizes are then automatically positioned, while their occlusal end is leveled to bone ridge, and evaluated. Radial safety margins are used for the assessment of the implant safety distance from neighboring anatomical structures and bone quantity and quality are estimated and taken into consideration. A case study demonstrates the concept and allows for its discussion.}

This registry is used to identify suitable destination file formats for different purposes, and provides a resource to aid in the recovery of information from these formats in the future.}

To continually improve design quality and efficiency, companies must consider how to speed design processes, minimise human-errors, avoid unnecessary iterations, and sustain knowledge embedded in the design process. All of these issues strongly concern one topic: how to make and exploit records of design activities. Using process modelling ideas, this paper introduces a new method called component-based records, in place of traditional design reports. The proposed method records transaction elements of the actual design processes undertaken in a design episode, which aims to continually improve design quality and efficiency, reduce designers’ workload for routine tasks, and sustain competitiveness of companies.}

When users input a new set of semantic parameters, a new 3D human body will be synthesized from the exemplar human bodies in the database. This approach involves simpler computation compared to non-linear methods while maintaining quality outputs. A semantic parametric design in interactive speed can be implemented easily. Furthermore, a new method is developed to quickly predict whether the parameter values is reasonable or not, with the training models in the human body database. The reconstructed human bodies in this way will all have the same topology (i.e., mesh connectivity), which facilitates the freeform design automation of human-centric products.}

The majority of research to date emphasizes a high degree of anthropomorphism with respect to robot appearance and communication to support positive perceptions of robots. However, these features are often examined separately. As a result, there has been little evidence of possible interaction effects when implementing different design principles with a particular focus on matched features. An online survey with two different samples (sample 1: random; sample 2: healthcare professionals and trainees) is reported that investigate whether certain feature combinations are preferred for care robots. The attributes appearance (human-like, animal-like, technical), size (small, large), and communication (speech, sound, text) were combined. Results suggest that communication is the key determinant of robot preference. With regard to feature combinations the survey showed an overall preference for anthropomorphic features. Furthermore, the occurrence of matched features led to an additional improvement of preference ratings. Both samples provide similar results with high correlations. The obtained findings can therefore serve as a basis for the implementation of concrete design principles for social robotics in healthcare.}

The quality of a Business to Consumer system may be assessed from two complementary, orthogonal, points of view: as a software system and as a service to end-users/customers.

As a service it must be assessed by customer's perspective, the end-user. They provide a bottom up evaluation approach of the system. In this work, these points of view are combined in a weighted model which uses the external quality characteristics and sub-characteristics of ISO9126 as a baseline for further decomposition into technical and user-oriented features.

Nevertheless, at present, few software tools can efficiently perform different flow visualizations for watershed modeling. In this study, a virtual watershed platform was developed and various implementation methods of flow visualization were assessed, such as scalar field visualization, vector field visualization, and visual water effects. In the platform, spatially distributed flow model results and georeferenced datasets are visualized in a virtual 3D environment. End users can conveniently explore modeling results within that environment. Based on analysis of the varying requirements of the flow visualization methods applied to watershed simulation, overheads associated with a user-determined switch between different systems were reduced, and the level of comprehensive information management and analysis of large volumes of watershed data was improved. This study shows that application of the watershed platform can enhance flow visualization in the water resources research community, and makes related water modeling more practical in support of water resources management.}

These iStar extensions have been proposed in an ad hoc way resulting in many problems of incompleteness, inconsistency and conflicts. Recently, the language was standardised, but it continues being extended. Thus, we consider that this is an adequate moment to study how to support the proposals of the next iStar extensions. In this paper, we define PRISE, a process to support the creation of iStar extensions which is driven by model-based development concepts, reuse of existing iStar extensions and guidelines of experts. This process can be customised. We illustrate the usage of PRISE by recreating five existing iStar extensions. Finally, we evaluated PRISE with interviews and a survey with experts; and, we performed an interview to analyse the opinion about the usage of the PRISE to create a new iStar extension by a novice. The evaluation and validation indicate good results to avoid problems and increase the quality of the proposals and well receptivity by the experts and novice.}

Poor materials management has been identified as a major source of low construction productivity, cost overrun and delays. Lack of active, accurate and integrated information flow from material planning, inventory, site use to monitoring and control is a major contributor to such problems. However, it is difficult to obtain such accurate information actively due to the nature of the industry, particularly for large or material intensive projects such as oil or water pipe-laying projects. This paper presents a Radio Frequency Identification system (RFID) facilitated construction material management system which is developed to tackle this problem. This latest technology helps project teams to collect material storage and usage information in an active and accurate way. Additionally, it facilitates the flow of information through the construction materials management process focusing on dynamic material planning, ordering and monitoring.

Collaboration requires successful and efficient sharing of knowledge, negotiation, coordination and management of activities. In distributed environments, organizational factors and decisions that foster teamwork must be mediated by technology. Design intent, rationale and history are important basic types of knowledge that knowledge management systems are required to capture, organize and manipulate to help generate new design knowledge. Efficient methods of representing design artefacts in different forms are needed that allow designers to interact most efficiently as well as support knowledge capture, transformation and collaborative activities.}

The industry and the academia are embracing 5G as the future network capable to support next generation vertical applications with different service requirements. To realize this vision in 5G network, the physical network has to be sliced into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes and structures which are dedicated to different types of services based on their requirements with different characteristics and requirements (e.g., a slice for massive IoT devices, smartphones or autonomous cars, etc.). Softwarization using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)in 5G networks are expected to fill the void of programmable control and management of network resources. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and updated solutions related to 5G network slicing using SDN and NFV. Firstly, we present 5G service quality and business requirements followed by a description of 5G network softwarization and slicing paradigms including essential concepts, history and different use cases. Secondly, we provide a tutorial of 5G network slicing technology enablers including SDN, NFV, MEC, cloud/Fog computing, network hypervisors, virtual machines & containers.

A comparison of various 5G architectural approaches in terms of practical implementations, technology adoptions and deployment strategies is presented. Moreover, we provide a discussion on various open source orchestrators and proof of concepts representing industrial contribution.

Given a human body in a specified pose as input, our method computes an approximate pressure distribution that also takes frictional forces and body torques into consideration which serves as an objective measure of comfort. Utilizing this information to find out where the body needs to be supported in order to maintain comfort of sitting, our algorithm can create a supporting mesh suited for a person in that specific pose. This is done in an automated fitting process, using a template model capable of supporting a large variety of sitting poses. The results can be used directly or can be considered as a starting point for further interactive design.}

abstract = {As the WDM technology matures and the demand for bandwidth increases, dynamic provisioning of lightpaths at the WDM layer becomes an important and challenging problem. Any distributed algorithm for routing dynamic traffic should be simple, efficient, and also scalable. Most of the multimedia and real-time applications require specific quality of service (QoS), hence it is important that the routing algorithm should provide lightpaths which satisfy the required QoS. The QoS also includes fault-tolerance besides guarantees on different metrics such as bandwidth, bit-error-rate, and reliability. In this paper, we propose distributed dynamic routing algorithms for QoS constrained routing and survivable routing, based on preferred link routing approach. For QoS constrained routing, we provide a common framework for routing connections with constraints on different types of metrics such as bandwidth (a concave metric), delay and bit-error-rate (additive metrics, and should be minimum for a best QoS path), and reliability (multiplicative metric, and should be maximum for a best path). The framework considers multiple QoS constrained routing which is an NP-Complete problem. We also propose a distributed routing algorithm for fault-tolerant connections, and describe how dedicated and shared protection can be provided in the case of single link failures. We have conducted simulation experiments with bit-error-rate and reliability as the metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed multiple constrained QoS routing algorithm. We have also studied the performance of the fault-tolerant routing in terms of call acceptance ratio, cost of the path, hop length, and call setup time, and compared the results with that of an existing approach. Our experimental results suggest that our algorithms out perform the existing methods with respect to the average number of calls accepted.}

Data warehousing, an integral part of this, provides an infrastructure that enables businesses to extract, cleanse, and store vast amounts of data. The basic purpose of a data warehouse is to empower the knowledge workers with information that allows them to make decisions based on a solid foundation of fact. However, only a fraction of the needed information exists on computers; the vast majority of a firm's intellectual assets exist as knowledge in the minds of its employees. What is needed is a new generation of knowledge-enabled systems that provides the infrastructure needed to capture, cleanse, store, organize, leverage, and disseminate not only data and information but also the knowledge of the firm. The purpose of this paper is to propose, as an extension to the data warehouse model, a knowledge warehouse (KW) architecture that will not only facilitate the capturing and coding of knowledge but also enhance the retrieval and sharing of knowledge across the organization. The knowledge warehouse proposed here suggests a different direction for DSS in the next decade. This new direction is based on an expanded purpose of DSS. That is, the purpose of DSS in knowledge improvement. This expanded purpose of DSS also suggests that the effectiveness of a DSS will, in the future, be measured based on how well it promotes and enhances knowledge, how well it improves the mental model(s) and understanding of the decision maker(s) and thereby how well it improves his/her decision making.}

abstract = {In a competitive and globalised business environment, a company can never out-perform its competitors, if it depends solely on its products alone. As a result, customer needs become an important factor to consider in new product development. In this work, a customer-oriented information system (COIS) was investigated and employed to establish a closer link between product re-innovation and customer involvement in the context of product concept development. It is aimed at improving design efficiency through managing multilevel product information, and reducing time and cost. In order to expedite the implementation of such an information system, a so-called functional attributes hierarchy (FAH) was proposed and developed to elicit product concepts and relevant design specifications from both generic and specific viewpoints. The correlation between them in terms of individual customer requirements was also identified with the utilisation of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique. In addition, an object-oriented technique that enables information stored in a relational database (RDB) to be accessed was developed. The development is aimed at eliminating the semantic gaps between the data model and engineering designs. A case study on wood golf club design was carried out to validate the bespoke COIS for product concept development.}

abstract = {The impact of information technology (IT) on research and development (R D) activities as well as on researchers and scientists are discussed in this paper. The lack of data related to the influence of modern IT on scientists and engineering researchers is highlighted. This issue is viewed on the basis of the generic characteristics of the relationship between IT and scientific research. The present day understanding of this relationship is reviewed by considering the role of calculations in R D and its places regarding research productivity. Light is also shed on the interaction between research practice and IT from two angles. First, the business side of managing an R D institution is considered and secondly, the aspects relating to the behaviour of researchers and research groups is discussed. IT’s impact on R D institutions in a developing environment is addressed further with emphasis on the most striking factors differentiating it from a developed environment. Some specific features related to information centre/user’s relationship in developing countries is also discussed. The overall scene in the developing Arab information arena could be summed up as one in which there is a reasonable level of scientific and technological information resources. This is not matched by an equal level of user’s appreciation of the role of IT in the enhancement of R D.}

abstract = {Cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) affect about 16 million people worldwide annually. CVA, also know as stroke, is a serious global health problem, and can cause significant physical limitations to those affected. Computed tomography is the most appropriate procedure to diagnose and evaluate the dimensions and magnitude of a stroke. Thus, in this article we present an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the classification of stroke from CT images applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in order to identifying a healthy brain, an ischemic stroke or a hemorrhagic stroke. Following the Transfer Learning concept CNN was combined with different consolidated Machine Learning methods such as Bayesian Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines. Our approach contributes to the automation of the diagnostic process by a competent method that is able to obtain information imperceptible to the human eye, and thus it contributes to a more precise diagnosis. In addition, with the advent of IoT, a highly efficient and flexible new instrument emerges to address issues related to health care services and specifically in our approach can provide remote diagnoses and monitoring of patients. The approach was validated by analyzing the parameters Accuracy, F1-Score, Recall, Precision and processing time. The results showed that CNN obtained 100% Accuracy, F1-Score, Recall and Precision in combination with most of the classifiers tested. The shortest training and test times were 0.015 s and 0.001 s, respectively, both in combination with the Bayesian Classifier. Thus, our proposed approach demonstrates efficiency and reliability to detect strokes.}

To achieve this objective, we need to clarify how to model the existing methods and how to assemble method fragments into new project-specific methods, so-called situational methods. Especially, to produce meaningful methods, we should impose some constraints or rules on method assembly processes. In this paper, we propose a framework for hierarchical method modelling (meta-modelling) from three orthogonal dimensions: perspectives, abstraction and granularity. According to each dimension, methods and/or method fragments are hierarchically modelled and classified. Furthermore, we present a method assembly mechanism and its formalization as a set of rules. These rules are both syntactic and semantic constraints and presented in first order predicate logic so that they can play an important role in the assembly process of syntactically and semantically meaningful methods from existing method fragments. The benefit of our technique is illustrated by an example of method assembly, namely the integration of the Object Model and Harel's Statechart into Objectcharts.}

We took a separation-based UI architecture and modified it with a domain specific language to support the independence of UI creation thereby resolving some of the aforementioned problems. A methodology incorporating this architecture into the development process is proposed. A climate science application was created to verify the validity of the methodology using modern practices of UX, DSLs, code generation, and model-driven engineering. Analyzing related work provides an overview of other methods similar to our method. Subsequently we evaluate the climate science application, conclude, and detail future work.}

It is concluded that PCS are not just information delivery machines, but also actors in a dialogue. Different designs of PCS will lead to the action space on part of the human actors changing in different ways.}

Thirteen non-academic projects were chosen because the HFE interventions involved changed the way workers work at their workplaces. Companies involved range from multi-national corporations and military organizations with thousands of employees to small trading companies with less than 10 employees. In 5 cases the HFE recommendations were fully adopted and well appreciated. In 4 they were largely ignored and not appreciated, with partial adoption and some appreciation in the other 4 cases. Three factors that predict appreciation were identified: (i) alignment between the benefits HFE can provide and the project's key performance indices; (ii) awareness of HFE among the client's senior management; and (iii) a team organization appropriate for applying HFE recommendations. Having an HFE specialist on the client's side can greatly increase levels of appreciation, but lack of such a specialist will not affect levels of appreciation. A clear contractual requirement for HFE intervention does not promote appreciation significantly, but its absence can greatly reduce levels of appreciation. These relationships are discussed using the Kano's model of quality. Means to generate greater appreciation of the benefits of HFE are discussed. Partial finding of this study was presented at the keynote address of the 1st Human Factors and Ergonomics Society of Philippines Conference held in Nov., 2012.}

Collaborative computer games have evolved from single-player to massively multiplayer awareness-demanding games, usually involving collaboration to achieve team goals. As a consequence of such evolution, these players should be provided with awareness information that enables them to perform collaborative tasks with other team members.
Objective
The objective of this work is the analysis of current awareness interpretations in order to develop an awareness interpretation that collects the awareness needs of such games.
Method
This analysis has been conducted by means of a step-by-step Thematic Analysis of current interpretations that led us to extract the most relevant awareness elements defined in existing interpretations. The developed awareness interpretation was empirically evaluated by means of several surveys aimed at assessing whether the implementation of the interpretation elements in a game would improve the players enjoyment.
Results
The Thematic Synthesis Analysis concluded that none of the current awareness interpretations can deal properly with collaborative computer games, specifically due to collaboration and social & group dynamics. This Thematic Synthesis Analysis led us to coin Gamespace Awareness, a new awareness interpretation based on a combination of the previously analyzed awareness interpretations, which is suitable for collaborative computer games. The interpretation was positively evaluated for two games, namely a first person shooter and a real-time strategy game.
Conclusions
Gamespace Awareness combines the potential awareness elements needed for collaborative computer games, making it possible to identify the awareness requirements of these games from the very beginning.}

It is dependent on local data communications from its onboard sensors and to its onboard effectors, and on telecommunications links over which it receives data-feeds and command-feeds from terrestrial and perhaps airborne sources and from satellites. A drone acts on the world, and is therefore a robot. The remote pilots, and the operators of drone facilities such as cameras, depend on high-tech tools that interpret data that display transmitted, enhanced and generated image and video, and that enable the composition of commands. So drone operators are already cyborgs. Many drones carry cameras and are used for surveillance. Computing, data communications, robotics, cyborgisation and surveillance offer power and possibilities, but with them come disbenefits and risks. Critical literatures exist in relation to all of those areas. An inspection of those literatures should provide insights into the limitations of drones, and the impacts and implications arising from their use.}

These tookits are developed in C++, and together they provide the basic functions for constructing a distributed object-oriented environment. They were developed as separate, independent libraries, although Interviews and Allegro were developed by the same group. The fact that it was easy to integrate these rather large libraries must be attributed to the use of OO techniques. We will elaborate on the functionality contained in these libraries below.

This desire for alternate, subjective perspectives is consistent with art theory and practice, and even though rigor and formalism generally mean different things to artists and computer scientists, there is room for collaboration and connection by applying artistic aesthetics to computing, while maintaining that which makes computing a viable, usable field. This new area is called aesthetic computing. Within this area, there is an attempt to balance qualitative with quantitative representational aspects of visual computing, recognizing that aesthetics creates a dimension that is consistent with supporting numerous visual perspectives. We introduce one aspect of aesthetic computing, with specific examples from our research and teaching to illustrate the potential and possibilities associated with alternate representations of discrete structures such as finite state automata and a data flow network. We limit ourselves, and our methodology, to model notations with components that bear a largely symbolic connection to what they represent, thus providing greater degrees of representational freedom. We show that by exploring aesthetics, we surface some important philosophical and cultural questions regarding notation, which turn out to be at least as important as the algorithmic and procedural means of achieving customized model component representations.}

Important aspects are how well depth and shape information can be perceived, as coding of these aspects is essential to enable an understandable representation of complex 3D data. In practice, there is usually little time to perform such studies, and the establishment and conduction of user studies can be labour-intensive. In addition, it can be difficult to reach enough participants to obtain expressive results regarding the quality of different visualization techniques. In this paper, we propose a framework that allows visualization researchers to quickly create task-based user studies on depth and shape perception for different surface visualizations and perform the resulting tasks via a web interface. With our approach, the effort for generating user studies is reduced and at the same time the web-based component allows researchers to attract more participants to their study. We demonstrate our framework by applying shape and depth evaluation tasks to visualizations of various surface representations used in many technical and biomedical applications.}

abstract = {The global industry is currently facing a growing increase in the competitiveness that forces companies to adopt and develop new strategies and methods of production. Therefore, one of the most relevant challenges in manufacturing engineering is innovatively integrating Product, Process and Factory dimensions and life cycles, in a holistic approach, from design to recycling/disposal and reuse. The challenge faced here is the synchronization and simultaneous generation of all three-domain models by integrating manufacturing engineering knowledge into the early stage of the modelling and planning processes. The next generation of factories has to be modular, scalable, flexible, open, agile and knowledge-based in order to be able to adapt, in real time, to the continuously changing market demands, technology options and regulations. Therefore, integration, flexibility and efficiency requirements and the ability to simulate the production life cycle of a factory play a crucial role in decreasing ramp-up and design times. Furthermore they play a crucial role in improving the performance in the evaluation and reconfiguration of new or existing facilities, in supporting management decisions and providing tools that can guarantee real-time performance monitoring. Therefore, it is necessary to research and implement the underlying models and ideas during the foundation stage of a new conceptual framework, which is designed to be implemented in the next generation of factories. This will be supported by suitable Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and digital infrastructures and should lay down the foundations for future applications in this research area—the industrial paradigm of “Factory as a Product”. In line with the context presented here, we propose the development of factory templates to address the design and operation practices throughout the entire life cycle of the factory. Different dimensions of the factory templates are presented in this paper; they cover the design and creation of the factory, its remodelling and even the disassembly and recycling stages. This entire study takes into account relevant factors such as costs, quality, time, flexibility, environmental and social issues and energy efficiency. Throughout the article, different kinds of models are presented, which describe and adjust the structure of the analysis, design and development of a factory integration project that helps provide a formal analysis of the system. Furthermore, templates integrating the factory's response to internal and external disturbances will also be developed.}

We introduce the notion of report schemata, specified in terms of record types and binary relations, as a framework for analyzing report structures and interactions among reports. Four classes of binary relations are identified, each being characteristic of a certain type of elementary report. Multiple binary relations are used to specify more complex reports. We also discuss concepts such as report covering and the maximal members for transforming reports to a parsimonious representation for data base design. Finally, we formulate this report-driven data base design methodology as an expert consulting system in Artificial Intelligence.}

However, studies have generally investigated videos showing only single viewpoints, for example, face-to-face or over-the-shoulder. Single views may not be appropriate for learning complex medical procedures involving spatial viewpoint changes. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effect of mixed camera viewpoints on learning a complex medical hand procedure from a video. Using a pretest-posttest paradigm, 43 students at a French nursing school had to learn a complex hand procedure from a video showing an expert nurse teacher inserting an indwelling catheter in a closed system using a simulation mannequin. Three video conditions were compared, delivering the same information in the same amount of time, from different viewpoints: (i) face-to-face only (FtF), (ii) over-the-shoulder only (OtS), and (iii) alternating face-to-face and over-the-shoulder views for each step of the procedure (MixW). The students were randomly assigned (N = 10–11) to one of four groups: the three experimental viewing conditions (FtF, OtS, MixW) and a control condition without video. Pre- and post-tests consisted of performing the hand procedure in a fully equipped full-scale simulation room. Results showed that learners in the mixed viewpoint (MixW) group performed better than the other groups (FtF, OtS, and control condition). Learners in the FtF and OtS groups outperformed those in the control group.}

abstract = {This article presents a new methodology that enables designers to include in simulations not only the physics aspects of artifact behavior, but also human actions. The motivation for this research came from the fact that none of the conventional approaches to engineering simulations includes manipulative control of products by users as foreseen by designers. By implementing control over physics simulations, changes in parameters can be introduced that alter the course of the simulated process. As a means to do this, we propose to use scenario bundles, with which designers can operationalize their conjectures of how human users interact with products as a series of interconnected simulations. For the imaginary use process described in a scenario bundle, the designer can specify various product designs, user characteristics, and environments, which may in each case lead to different concatenations of simulation actions. The proposal facilitates the exploration of possible mismatches and anomalies in use processes. In this article, we describe the theoretical fundamentals and the overall concept of the proposed methodology, as well as its realization as a proof-of-concept implementation. This implementation can be used as a tool to specify scenario bundles and to perform controlled simulations of human–product interaction. The use of the tool is demonstrated through a practical example. Although the implementation has proven to be successful in terms of executing scenario bundles, two bottlenecks need further attention: (i) devising stable algorithms for large deformations in physical interaction simulation and (ii) incorporation of already existing algorithms for simulation of low-level human motion control.}

We describe a QoS architecture and implementation that together help to address these challenges. The General-purpose Architecture for Reservation and Allocation (GARA) supports flow-specific QoS specification, immediate and advance reservation, and online monitoring and control of both individual resources and heterogeneous resource ensembles. Mechanisms provided by the Globus Toolkit are used to address resource discovery and security issues when resources span multiple administrative domains. Our prototype GARA implementation builds on differentiated services mechanisms to enable the coordinated management of two distinct flow types—foreground media flows and background bulk transfers—as well as the co-reservation of networks, CPUs, and storage systems. We present results obtained on a wide area differentiated services testbed that demonstrate our ability to deliver QoS for realistic flows.}

Many of the technological limitations of the past have been, or are being, overcome. This makes HIS viable and extremely valuable to all members of the health care delivery team. Due to the magnitude of the investment in the implementation and support of HIS, in terms of both financial and human effort, and the rapid rate at which information technology is developing, hospital managers in many parts of the world face the dilemma of whether to invest in HIS now or wait a little longer until the development has ‘settled down’ and become more affordable. We are certain of two things with respect to information technology (IT); these are that hardware technology will continue to develop at an ever increasing rate, and that the cost thereof will continue to decrease, to the extent that many are of the opinion that the IT revolution is now upon us. The question of whether an evolutionary or revolutionary development in HIS will ensue continues. It is believed that financial considerations will dictate. It is however generally accepted that a fast-track evolutionary development in HIS will take place due to the need to protect the investments of the past, and organisational dependence on operational HIS. This paper looks at technical issues to be considered when migrating from the Hospital Information Systems of today, to those that are likely to be operational within the next decade. The latter would constitute highly functional, highly integrated multi-modality systems within the organisation which would utilise ‘open’ communications networks. Information would thus be allowed to readily flow across borders, both within and beyond the boundaries of the institution.}

However, suitable cost and stable connectivity cannot be strongly guaranteed by existing architectures such as cellular networks, vehicular ad hoc networks, etc. With the prosperous development of artificial intelligence, cloud/edge computing and 5G network slicing, a more intelligent vehicular network is under deliberation. In this paper, an innovative paradigm called Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV) is proposed to help address the aforementioned challenge. Different from existing works, which mainly focus on communication technologies, CIoV enhances transportation safety and network security by mining effective information from both physical and network data space. We first present an overview of CIoV including its evolution, related technologies, and architecture. Then we highlight crucial cognitive design issues from three perspectives, namely, intra-vehicle network, inter-vehicle network and beyond-vehicle network. Simulations are then conducted to prove the effect of CIoV and finally some open issues will be further discussed. Our study explores this novel architecture of CIoV, as well as research opportunities in vehicular network.}

One of the challenges in software development regards the appropriate coupling of separated code elements in order to correctly build initially expected high-level software functionalities. In this context, we address issues related to the dynamic composition of such code elements (i.e. how they are dynamically plugged together) as well as their collaboration (i.e. how they work together). We also consider the limitation of build-level dependencies, to avoid the entire re-compilation and re-deployment of a software when modifying it or integrating new functionalities. To solve these issues, we propose a new design pattern coupling role and component concepts and illustrate its relevance for medical software. Compared to most related works focusing on few role concepts while ignoring others, the proposed pattern integrates many role concepts as first-class entities, including in particular a refinement of the notion of collaboration. Another significant contribution of our proposal concerns the coupling of role and component concepts. Roles are related to the functional aspects of a target software program (composition and collaboration of functional units). Components correspond to the physical distribution of code elements with limited build-level dependencies. As illustrated in this paper, such a coupling enables to instantiate a software program using a generic main program together with a description file focusing on software functionalities only. Related code elements are transparently retrieved and composed at run-time before appropriately collaborating, regardless the specificity of their distribution over components.}

The human associates these choices with end-functionality and is confident that the resulting grasp will be able to meet task requirements. We refer to these choices on the use of hand-parts underlying grasp formation as the grasp intention. Modeling the grasp intention offers a paradigm whereby decisions underlying grasp formation may be related to the functional properties of the realized grasp in terms of quantities which may be sensed/recognized or controlled. In this paper we model grasp intention as mix of oppositions between hand parts. Sub-parts of the hand acting in opposition to each other are viewed as a basis from which grasps are formed. We compute a set of such possible oppositions and determine the most likely combination from the raw information present in a demonstrated grasp. An intermediate representation of raw sensor data exposes interactions between elementary grasping surfaces. From this, the most likely combination of oppositions is inferred. Grasping experiments with humans show that the proposed approach is robust enough to correctly capture the intention in demonstrated grasps across a wide range of hand functionality.}

abstract = {Affective computing involves human–computer interaction (HCI) where an interface can detect and respond in context to a user’s emotions. Emotions play an essential role in the daily activities of a human during work and, as a consequence, can critically affect their decision-making. Recent research on affective computing opens the door to exploring the emotional aspects of computer aided tasks and HCI; however, there is little research in this area related to computer aided design (CAD). There is an established connection between emotional and cognitive processes and without these emotional markers decision-making in humans is almost non-existent. The holy grail of engineering design is for a concept to be ‘right-first-time’ and only by delving into the affect-cognitive domain will insights in terms of the associability of critical decision-making and the underlying intent of engineering decisions and tasks be better understood. Work in this field aims to recognize, interpret and process human emotions in order to support and adapt computer-based systems and their associated interfaces to user behaviors and to elicit appropriate system responses. This is a very contemporary area in engineering design research. One key aspect of provisioning CAD systems with the capability to detect the emotional state of the engineer is to lessen the chance of distorted reasoning as a result of irrational judgements. Work in this area can potentially identify emotional markers that influence the coherence/incoherence of reasoning against knowledge as well as the potential quality and suitability of a specific engineering solution or approach. This paper proposes and investigates a methodology to determine the emotional aspects attributed to a set of CAD design tasks by analyzing the CAD operators’ psycho-physiological signals. Two sets of experiments were conducted. A pilot case study focused on modeling tasks carried out in Solid Edge™ was run to prove the validity of the methodology, the tools applied and subsequent analysis. The main case study extended this to more wide-ranging user logging, incorporating a series of configuration and optimization tasks in Siemens NX™ for a real design task. Psycho-physiological signals of electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin resistance (GSR)/electrocardiography (ECG) were recorded along with a log of CAD system user interactions. A fuzzy logic model was established to map the psycho-physiological signals to a set of key emotions, namely frustration, satisfaction, engagement and challenge and the results analyzed. The methodology and subsequent analysis applied was found to be repeatable. Over the various task action-chains the elicitation and interpretation of each participant’s emotions were successfully carried out with significant correlations demonstrated between the associated engineers’ CAD activities and their reported emotional states.}

Storytelling by a child, as an educational activity, influences the child’s linguistic ability, thought process, imagination, and creativity significantly. Many researchers have made extensive studies in storytelling systems for children. While there presently exist many software-based storytelling applications, most are deemed not completely suitable for Chinese children. In this paper, combining the characteristics of Chinese children and using the multimodal interaction pattern based on speech and pen-gesture, we present children a 3D storytelling system which uses user-centered scenario-based design method. The usability of the storytelling system is evaluated and the results suggest that all the users generally feel pretty satisfied with the system.}

abstract = {The use of free-form shapes has become mainstream to design complex products that have to fulfil engineering requirements as well as aesthetic criteria. Even if today’s CAD systems can easily represent free-form shapes by means of NURBS surfaces, their definition and modification still require a deep knowledge and a great skill in the manipulation of the underlying mathematical models. The implemented free-form shapes design operators are time consuming and do not enable fast modifications. To overcome these limits, some researches have been undertaken to try to adapt the feature concept, successfully adopted for the design of regular shapes, in the free-form domain. It gives rise to a set of free-form features modelling strategies. This paper gathers together the state-of-the-art of these advances. The various approaches are depicted and compared with respect to a very precise set of criteria expressing the needs in aesthetic and engineering designs. The limits and future trends are presented.}

abstract = {Structured modeling is critical to the design, development, and implementation of many systems including computer software, business processes, and data networks. Since the creation of structured models relies on the knowledge of many organizational stakeholders, groups often accomplish this task. Group support systems (GSS) focus on the support of group processes and would appear to be useful for structured modeling; however, GSS usually only provide textual or decision related output rather than the structured models needed for many design processes. This paper proposes a class of systems, structured modeling GSS (smGSS), which adds support for the development of structured models to standard GSS. Since past research has shown that research results may be difficult to compare across studies when the system under investigation is not well defined, this paper develops a product design theory that defines the required characteristics of and testable design propositions for an smGSS as derived from existing theory and empirical investigations.}

Subsequently, a sequence-based optimisation technique, genetic algorithms, is employed to generate near optimal disassembly sequence from all the feasible combination of these disassembly operations. Based on the DCG, an object-oriented intelligent disassembly sequence planner for maintenance has been developed. The prototype system comprises three modules each having a set of objects. Users are able to view the entire disassembly process in accordance to the near optimal sequence generated by the planner via a graphical user interface. Two case studies, which are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the planner, are presented.}

However, successful collaborative product design depends on the ability to effectively manage and share engineering knowledge and data throughout the entire product development process. Co-design software platforms aim to facilitate cooperation in distributed teams. In the context of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) the advanced co-design software implementation to support the supply chain is not a trivial task. SMEs have peculiar characteristics such as flexibility, ICT skills and financial resources, which are difficult to be integrated within a structured design network. This paper presents a method to define and evaluate a co-design platform dedicated to SMEs in the mechanical product field. System architecture is defined by applying suitable metrics based on collaborative process characteristics in order to assess functionality performance of the available tools. Benchmarking is based on different levels of collaboration recognized in the typical product development process in SMEs. Correlation between process metrics, software functionalities and specific collaboration requirements is managed by adopting Quality Function Deployment (QFD) techniques. A practical case study allows the robustness of the proposed method to be verified and the main advantages and future developments to be discussed.}

The analysis kernel is developed at the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) and is entitled as “Platform of Inelastic Structural Analysis for 3D systems (PISA3D)”. The design of PISA3D framework adopts the Design Pattern and the Unified Process. PISA3D provides structural modeling and high computational efficiency for engineers and researchers to simulate the responses of nonlinear systems under various kinds of load effects. It includes static or cyclic loads, displacements, earthquake ground accelerations, and earthquake aftershocks. PISA3D is easy to extend and maintain due to its object-oriented nature. Advanced users can derive or compose its objects’ libraries to perform different types of structural analyses. Based on object-oriented techniques, VISA3D (Visualization of Inelastic Structural Analysis for 3D systems) has been implemented with usage of OpenGL for 3D graphics and MFC for graphical user interface (GUI). Its framework allows further extension on new input formats and new element types. VISA3D has been mainly developed as a post-processor to examine the analytical results of PISA3D through 2D/3D static or dynamic graphic approaches. It includes graphical checking of the structural model, mode shapes, deformations, extents and locations of plastic hinges, plotting of nodal velocity, acceleration, and energy distribution time histories. This paper then introduces NCREE’s recent development on the pre-processing framework GISA3D (Graphical Interface of Inelastic Structural Analysis for 3D systems). The GISA3D does not only supply features as a “post-processor”, but also fully supports operations of “model generation” via mouse motion. Users can create, remove, modify and set elements/nodes through mouse clicking, dragging and selecting. Finally, this paper illustrates the networked sub-structural pseudo dynamic tests using PISA3D as the analysis engine, and concludes with several successful applications of PISA3D/VISA3D/GISA3D on various researches and actual structural engineering projects.}

abstract = {Graphics applications often need to manipulate numerous graphical objects stored as polygonal models. Mesh simplification is an approach to vary the levels of visual details as appropriate, thereby improving on the overall performance of the applications. Different mesh simplification algorithms may cater for different needs, producing diversified types of simplified polygonal model as a result. Testing mesh simplification implementations is essential to assure the quality of the graphics applications. However, it is very difficult to determine the oracles (or expected outcomes) of mesh simplification for the verification of test results. A reference model is an implementation closely related to the program under test. Is it possible to use such reference models as pseudo-oracles for testing mesh simplification programs? If so, how effective are they? This paper presents a fault-based pattern classification methodology called PAT, to address the questions. In PAT, we train the C4.5 classifier using black-box features of samples from a reference model and its fault-based versions, in order to test samples from the subject program. We evaluate PAT using four implementations of mesh simplification algorithms as reference models applied to 44 open-source three-dimensional polygonal models. Empirical results reveal that the use of a reference model as a pseudo-oracle is effective for testing the implementations of resembling mesh simplification algorithms. However, the results also show a tradeoff: When compared with a simple reference model, the use of a resembling but sophisticated reference model is more effective and accurate but less robust.}

The prospective mistakes and omissions in ontologies have an influence on the exploitation of the full potential of exchanging data. For this reason, the process of ontology evaluation has a great impact on the higher degree of reuse and a better cooperation over the boundaries of applications and domains. However, this process is quite complex and it requires the specified knowledge about available methods and tools supporting the ontology evaluation process.

Google and Mozilla estimate their expenses for their CI systems in millions of dollars. To reduce the cost of CI, researchers developed multiple approaches to reduce its computational workload requirements. However, these approaches sometimes make mispredictions and skip failing builds which are not desirable to be skipped. Thus, in this paper, we aim to save computational cost in CI, while also maximizing the observation of failing builds, i.e., to skip builds more safely. First, we perform empirical studies to understand which builds are safe to skip, starting from CI-Skip rules (Abdalkareem et al., 2019) that characterize builds that developers decide to skip. We observe that CI-Skip rules are not so safe as expected. We then develop a collection of CI-Run rules that can complement these rules. Based on our findings, we propose PreciseBuildSkip, a novel approach that maximizes build failure observation and reduces the cost of CI through the strategy of build selection. We evaluate our approach and results show that our approach saved more cost (5.5%) than the safest existing technique but reduced the falsely skipped failing builds from 4.1% to 0% (median value).}

However, as is often the case in other manufacturing processes, the manufacturability of die castings is not considered until the design has been nearly completed and detailed. Primarily, this is due to the limited capability of current Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) tools to support design evaluation, especially during preliminary design. In this paper, we present a new volume-based geometric reasoning and visualization approach to support this task. This system is very efficient in terms of computation time and can evaluate the whole range of designs regardless of their shape complexity. In addition, it is very simple-to-use and the results are self-evident. The current focus is on thermal- and flow-related problems in die casting. Our approach, however, is general and can be applied to other manufacturing processes.}

Only pure boundary representations that cannot be parametrically edited are transferable [Geometric Modeling: Theory and Practice (1997)]. There are two approaches for the exchange of design intents such as parameters, features, and constraints. The first is an explicit approach based on constraints between pre-defined parameters and features. The second is a procedural approach based on the sequence of operations issued to construct the models. The authors have previously proposed a macro-parametric approach [International Journal of CAD/CAM 2 (2002) 23], which is a variation of the procedural approach. In this approach, CAD models can be exchanged in the form of macro files, which include the history of modeling commands. To exchange CAD models using the macro-parametric approach, a set of standard modeling commands should be defined.

Furthermore, the variety of such hidden axes across different cars/brands can be summarized in reduced dimensional spaces. Because features revealed by this technique are consistent with the framework of universal rules for aesthetic experiences (e.g., symmetry and perceptual problem solving), this could be useful to evaluate some aspects of aesthetic values quantitatively in car interiors.}

abstract = {Constraint-based modeling is one of the most modern methods of product design. This paper illustrates a collaborative design and manufacture procedures based on a new approach under the constraint-based solver for product design. Such a method can be used for the collaborative computer-aided design/manufacture systems. A developing model will be constructed from conceptual design to tool-paths generation, and a case study of how to make a playing doll house was presented to verify this system. The solver generates geometric models automatically and hierarchically when sufficient constraint relationships between geometric objects are given. By examining this developing model, all different operations can be integrated tightly and quickly from different locations and sub-systems. Also, benefits such as reduction in designing time, prototype-testing time and engineering personnel requirements, as well as mistake-free operation and simplification of manufacturing are attainable.}

Beside their own interest in the design and synthesis of resource-constrained omega-regular specifications, energy parity games provide one of the simplest model of games with combined qualitative and quantitative objectives. Our main results are as follows: (a) exponential memory is sufficient and may be necessary for winning strategies in energy parity games; (b) the problem of deciding the winner in energy parity games can be solved in NP ∩ coNP; and (c) we give an algorithm to solve energy parity by reduction to energy games. We also show that the problem of deciding the winner in energy parity games is logspace-equivalent to the problem of deciding the winner in mean-payoff parity games, which can thus be solved in NP ∩ coNP.

This fit of cognitive activities and OO characteristics appeals to many system developers. Contrary to the claim of naturalness, many students and practitioners report difficulties learning and using OO techniques. To understand why OO approaches seem to be difficult to learn and use, we illustrate the consistency of common characteristics of OO techniques and the cognitive activities of systems designers. A group of graduate students identified 148 beliefs, facts, and ideas pertaining to OO complexity. Researchers classified each item in terms of the abstraction, communication, problem-orientation, and shared behavior characteristics common to OO approaches. Then classified each item in terms of the problem understanding, problem decomposition, and design solution cognitive activities. The consistency of the two classifications confirms that claims are supported by usage. However, it seems that methodology and project management are part of the task of developing information systems (ISs) that are not adequately addressed by OO approaches.}

keywords = {Use case modeling, Belief, Uncertainty},
abstract = {Context
Latent uncertainty in the context of software-intensive systems (e.g., Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)) demands explicit attention right from the start of development. Use case modeling—a commonly used method for specifying requirements in practice, should also be extended for explicitly specifying uncertainty.
Objective
Since uncertainty is a common phenomenon in requirements engineering, it is best to address it explicitly by identifying, qualifying, and, where possible, quantifying uncertainty at the beginning stage. The ultimate aim, though not within the scope of this paper, was to use these use cases as the starting point to create test-ready models to support automated testing of CPSs under uncertainty.
Method
We extend the Restricted Use Case Modeling (RUCM) methodology and its supporting tool to specify uncertainty as part of system requirements. Such uncertainties include those caused by insufficient domain expertise of stakeholders, disagreements among them, and known uncertainties about assumptions about the environment of the system. The extended RUCM, called U-RUCM, inherits the features of RUCM, such as automated analyses and generation of models, to mention but a few. Consequently, U-RUCM provides all the key benefits offered by RUCM (i.e., reducing ambiguities in requirements), but also, it allows specification of uncertainties with the possibilities of reasoning and refining existing ones and even uncovering unknown ones.
Results
We evaluated U-RUCM with two industrial CPS case studies. After refining RUCM models (specifying initial requirements), by applying the U-RUCM methodology, we successfully identified and specified additional 306% and 512% (previously unknown) uncertainty requirements, as compared to the initial requirements specified in RUCM. This showed that, with U-RUCM, we were able to get a significantly better and more precise characterization of uncertainties in requirement engineering.
Conclusion
Evaluation results show that U-RUCM is an effective methodology (with tool support) for dealing with uncertainty in requirements engineering. We present our experience, lessons learned, and future challenges, based on the two industrial case studies.}

I argue that this field of engineering requires a special setup of the optimization model that considers the uniqueness of buildings, and allows the designer to interact with the optimization in order to assess qualities of aesthetics, expression, and building function. For this reason, the approach applies a performance optimization based on resource consumption extended by preference criteria. Furthermore, building design-specific components serve for the decomposition and an interactive way of working. The component scheme follows the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) as a common Building Information Model (BIM) standard in order to allow a seamless integration into an interactive CAD working process in the future. A representative case study dealing with a frame-based hall design serves to illustrate these considerations. An N-Square diagram or Design Structure Matrix (DSM) represents the system of components with the disciplinary dependencies and workflow of the analysis. The application of a Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) leads to demonstrable results.}

System knowledge was organized into rules for selection of the next form to be analyzed, identification of the determinants of functional dependencies, derivation of single attribute determinant functional dependencies inference of multi-attribute determinant functional dependencies.

The goal of this work is to enable programmers to write applications that manipulate (i.e. acquire, transport, process, store and present) and synchronize time-critical information streams, and do so with an ease comparable to that of manipulating text or graphics on a workstation today. This paper provides a description of the different types of temporal relationships required by time-critical applications, and provides a means of expressing these relationships to the underlying system in a minimally constraining fashion (i.e. through a technique called ‘loose synchronization’). The central concept behind the mechanisms described here is the notion of time-regulated transport of time-critical information being provided by means of mechanisms that are software analogues to Phase-Locked Loops (PLL).}

ISM gives insight into the relation between strategic investment decision rules and their simulated outcome. An evaluation procedure was developed testing ISM under operational use. The model was put to the test on three farms and with three extension officers. For each farm, three sets of recommendations were prepared: (1) without using ISM, based on a farm visit to collect data; (2) with use of ISM, based on a farm visit to collect data; and (3) with use of ISM, but with data collected by another advisor. The field test resulted in striking differences between recommendations based on ISM and those not based on ISM. In the latter recommendations, immediate farm expansion was regarded as not feasible for two of the three farms. When using ISM, a farm expansion strategy was advised for all three farms, however, not immediately. Without using ISM, replacement strategies for the buildings, manure costs, and family expenditures were largely ignored in the advice, contrary to the advice based on ISM. Adjusted for the difference in travelling time, the time required for preparing advice using ISM equaled 80% of the time required for preparing advice not using ISM. Whether or not the extension officer himself collected the farm data did not influence the advice.}

The increased use of Open Source Software (OSS) affects how software-intensive product development organizations (SIPDO) innovate and compete, moving them towards Open Innovation (OI). Specifically, software engineering tools have the potential for OI, but require better understanding regarding what to develop internally and what to acquire from outside the organization, and how to cooperate with potential competitors.
Aim
This paper aims at synthesizing a theory of openness for software engineering tools in SIPDOs, that can be utilized by managers in defining more efficient strategies towards OSS communities.
Method
We synthesize empirical evidence from a systematic mapping study, a case study, and a survey, using a narrative method. The synthesis method entails four steps: (1) Developing a preliminary synthesis, (2) Exploring the relationship between studies, (3) Assessing the validity of the synthesis, and (4) Theory formation.
Result
We present a theory of openness for OSS tools in software engineering in relation to four constructs: (1) Strategy, (2) Triggers, (3) Outcomes, and (4) Level of openness.
Conclusion
The theory reasons that openness provides opportunities to reduce the development cost and development time. Furthermore, OI positively impacts on the process and product innovation, but it requires investment by organizations in OSS communities. By betting on openness, organizations may be able to significantly increase their competitiveness.}

In this paper, we study a variety of compatibility problems between structuring operations and development steps and introduce notions of the realization of an interface specification by a module specification. These compatibility problems are studied in a categorical framework where specifications and developments steps are viewed as objects and morphisms in a “development category”. We show that compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the structuring operations can be extended to partial functors and give sufficient conditions for this property.}

This reduction is the basis of a method for proving behavioural theorems whenever an axiomatization of the behavioural equality is provided. Then we focus on the important special case of (partial) observational equalities where two elements are observationally equal if they cannot be distinguished by observable computations over some set of input values. We provide general conditions under which an obvious infinite axiomatization of the observational equality can be replaced by a finitary one and we provide methodological guidelines for finding such finitary axiomatizations. As a consequence, any proof system for first-order logic can be used to prove the behavioural validity of first-order formulas with respect to a given (partial) observational equality.}

Research objectives are (1) to engage documentary practice with emerging media technologies in an open data space; (2) to prototype tools to facilitate cyclical authoring among a contributors’ community. Interactive Documentary is here defined as a media production model with interactive author functions for constructing a narrative voice as a document of reality itself. The proposed system is envisioned for applications beyond motion picture genres, supporting the creation of living documents used in educational and collaborative project settings. Three types of users are anticipated: Authors, Contributors, and Observers. A formalization of traditional documentary production provides workflow analysis and modeling. The process of authoring is discussed in detail as well as system requirements and design specifications. A computational architecture hosts an author function; documentary authoring is implemented as query-display-edit facilitated by an inference engine. The system supports real-time enactive query across heterogeneous media resources, parallel media signal processing, and multi screen presentation and display formats. A use case takes upon a regional architectural history as an example of data design with domain sensitive ontology engineering. Ontology supports heterogeneous cross-referential capacity; its structure is reflected in a GUI designed to facilitate concept-based navigation across 2D graphics, 3D models, video, and audio resources.

abstract = {By treating the interfaces of a module specification as a production, we combine notions from the well known theory of algebraic graph grammars with the theory of large software system specifications to tackle the problem of designing modular systems. Given a goal specification, a library of module specifications as reusable software components and a collection of “primitive” realized data type specifications, the designing of a system consisting only of the library components to realize the goal is reduced to deriving the goal from the primitive specification using the given productions. If a derivation sequence exists, direct derivations and operations on productions are converted into the design of a modular system.}

abstract = {In software engineering, optimal feature selection for software product lines (SPLs) is an important and complicated task, involving simultaneous optimization of multiple competing objectives in large but highly constrained search spaces. A feature model is the standard representation of features of all possible products as well as the relationships among them for an SPL. Recently, various multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been used to search for valid product configurations. However, the issue of the balance between correctness and diversity of solutions obtained in a reasonable time has been found very challenging for these algorithms. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel aggregation-based dominance (ADO) for Pareto-based evolutionary algorithms to direct the search for high-quality solutions. Our method was tested on two widely used Pareto-based evolutionary algorithms: NSGA-II and SPEA2+SDE and validated on nine different SPLs with up to 10,000 features and two real-world SPLs with up to 7 objectives. Our experiments have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of both ADO-based NSGA-II and SPEA2+SDE: (1) Both algorithms could generate 100% valid solutions for all feature models. (2) The performance of both algorithms was improved as measured by the hypervolume metric in 7/9 and 8/9 feature models. (3) Even for the largest tested feature model with 10,000 features, it required under 40 s on a standard desktop to find 100% valid solutions in a single run of both algorithms.}

abstract = {This article presents the vision `A Concept and System Architecture for IT-Based Lifelong Learning'. The paper as a whole summarises the results of a project funded by the Ministry of Industrial Development of Sabah, Malaysia. The goal of the project was to develop a concept for IT-based Lifelong Learning including a case study based on a specific curriculum and considerations about potential business opportunities. Within the project experienced international researchers in the area of IT-based learning and training worked together in two preparation workshops and a final workshop about `IT-Based Lifelong Learning Systems' in Sabah, Malaysia, in March, 1997. The paper is based on the experiences of the authors from the International Network of Institutes for Computer Graphics (INI-GraphicsNet2INI-Graphics Net: Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics (IGD), Darmstadt and Rostock, D; Fraunhofer Center for Research in Computer Graphics, Inc. (CRCG), Providence, USA; Computer Graphics Center (ZGDV), Darmstadt, D; Centro de Computação Gráfica (CCG), Coimbra, P.2) in several R&D projects and has been reviewed, refined and revised by a group of local experts as well as several well renowned international experts and local/regional experts (Appendix A). The editors of the vision paper are J. L. Encarnação, M. Mengel and P. R. Bono.Section 1presents first the motivation of the paper, then international trends and the vision of an IT-based learning infrastructure integrating all parts of the society. The resulting goal, advising on how to go forward into the direction of the named vision, finalizes the Introduction. Section 2discusses the various roles of an IT-based learning environment and identifies user needs and requirements. Section 3proposes concepts for, and an architecture of, a learning system for IT-based lifelong learning.Section 4focuses on the Technical Implementation of the proposed system architecture. A generic approach for IT-based lifelong learning based on a conceptual system architecture is presented. This approach distinguishes between the services and environment of such a system. Firstly, the services offered by the system are described in more detail. These services include data management, cooperation and security services that are role- and activity-independent and have to be adapted to the underlying technical resources. Then the environments, including authoring, delivery and administration environments realizing a specific functionality for a specific user role and activity, are presented. The section is completed by addressing issues for a concrete implementation including implementation guidelines and assessment criteria and an implementation strategy to reduce the technological risk is suggested.Section 5describes a case study which will be initiated cooperatively by leading experts from the fields of visualization, multimedia, interaction and communication. This case study provides a narrow vertical section through the layers of the approach to lifelong learning both to demonstrate its effectiveness and to permit the evaluation of its efficiency. Section 6outlines a plan for the realization of the project as a whole. A glossary and bibliography complete the main part of the paper. In Appendix B(Recommendations), Appendix C(Project References), and Appendix D(Open Issues), are presented.}

abstract = {We present two empirical studies of visual search in dynamic 3D visualisations of large, randomly ordered, photo collections. The aim is to assess the possible effects of geometrical distortions on visual search effectiveness, efficiency and comfort, by comparing the influence of two perspective representations of photo collections on participants’ performance results and subjective judgments. Thumbnails of the 1000 or so photographs in each collection are plastered on the lateral surface of a vertical cylinder, either on the inside (inner view, IV) or on the outside (outer view, OV). IV and OV suggest two different interaction metaphors: locomotion in a virtual space (IV) versus manipulation of a virtual object (OV). They also implement different perspective distortions: enlargement and distortion of lateral columns (IV) versus enlargement of central columns and dwindling plus distortion of lateral columns (OV). Presentation of results focus on the second study, S2, which involved 20 participants and offered them strictly identical interaction facilities with the two views, unlike the initial pilot study, S1 (8 participants and slightly different interaction facilities between the two views). Participants in both studies were experienced computer users (average age: 25.15years, SD: 3.13). They performed two types of basic visual tasks that are carried out repeatedly while navigating photo collections: (i) searching for a photo meeting specific, visual and thematic, criteria, the photo and its location in the collection being unknown to participants (ST1) and (ii) looking for a visually familiar photo, the location of the photo being familiar to participants (ST2). According to post-experiment questionnaires and debriefings, all participants in S2 save one judged both 3D views positively in reference to standard 2D visualisations. Half of them preferred IV over OV, four appreciated OV better, and six expressed no clear opinion. Preferences were mainly motivated by the effects of perspective distortions on thumbnail visibility. They were barely influenced by interaction metaphors (e.g., the feeling of immersion induced by IV). Despite large inter-individual differences in performance, a majority of participants carried out ST1 tasks more effectively and efficiently with IV than with OV, as regards error rates (statistically significant difference) and search times (tendency). Performance results for ST2 tasks were similar with the two views, due, probably, to the simplicity and brevity of ST2 tasks. Perspective distortions seem to have exerted less influence on participants’ visual strategies than horizontal scrolling, a dynamic feature common to both views. Qualitative analyses of participants’ behaviours suggest that IV has the potential to support spatial memory better than OV, presumably thanks to the locomotion metaphor. These results indicate that perspective views have the potential to facilitate and improve visual search in unstructured picture collections provided that distortions are adapted to users’ individual visual capabilities. Further research is needed to better understand: (i) the actual relations between visual exploration strategies and geometrical properties of perspective visualisations and (ii) the influence of the manipulation and locomotion metaphors on spatial memory. This knowledge is necessary to further improve the comfort and effectiveness of visual search in large unstructured picture collections, using 3D visualisations.}

Today's vehicles have the capability of supporting real time multimedia acquisition. Vehicles with high illuminating infrared cameras and customized sensors can communicate with other on-road devices using dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) and 5G enabled communication technologies. Real time incidence of both urban and highway vehicular traffic environment can be captured and transmitted using vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication modes. Video streaming in vehicular IoT (VSV-IoT) environments is in growing stage with several challenges that need to be addressed ranging from limited resources in IoT devices, intermittent connection in vehicular networks, heterogeneous devices, dynamism and scalability in video encoding, bandwidth underutilization in video delivery, and attaining application-precise quality of service in video streaming. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review on video streaming in IoT environments focusing on vehicular communication perspective. Specifically, significance of video streaming in vehicular IoT environments is highlighted focusing on integration of vehicular communication with 5G enabled IoT technologies, and smart city oriented application areas for VSV-IoT. A taxonomy is presented for the classification of related literature on video streaming in vehicular network environments. Following the taxonomy, critical review of literature is performed focusing on major functional model, strengths and weaknesses. Metrics for video streaming in vehicular IoT environments are derived and comparatively analyzed in terms of their usage and evaluation capabilities. Open research challenges in VSV-IoT are identified as future directions of research in the area. The survey would benefit both IoT and vehicle industry practitioners and researchers, in terms of augmenting understanding of vehicular video streaming and its IoT related trends and issues.}

However, these approaches omit how to produce a good video. This missing guidance is one crucial reason why videos are not established in RE. We propose a quality model for videos representing a vision, so-called vision videos. Based on two literature reviews, we elaborate ten quality characteristics of videos and five quality characteristics of visions which together form a quality model for vision videos that includes all 15 quality characteristics. We provide two representations of the quality model: (a) a hierarchical decomposition of vision video quality into the quality characteristics and (b) a mapping of these characteristics to the video production and use process. While the hierarchical decomposition supports the evaluation of vision videos, the mapping provides guidance for video production. In an evaluation with 139 students, we investigated whether the 15 characteristics are related to the overall quality of vision videos perceived by the subjects from a developer’s the point of view. Six characteristics (video length, focus, prior knowledge, clarity, pleasure, and stability) correlated significantly with the likelihood that the subjects perceived a vision video as good. These relationships substantiate a fundamental relevance of the proposed quality model. Therefore, we conclude that the quality model is a sound basis for future refinements and extensions.}

abstract = {Existing systems which enable accessibility to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) by blind people follow an `adaptation strategy'; each system adopts its own hard-coded policy for reproducing visual dialogues in a non-visual form, without knowledge about the application domain or the particular dialogue characteristics. It is argued that non-visual user interfaces should be more than automatically generated adaptations of visual dialogues. Tools are required to facilitate purposeful non-visual interface construction, allowing iterative design and implementation. Such tools should cater for the construction of `integrated' user interfaces, which are concurrently accessible by sighted and blind users. Thus, the concept of dual user interfaces is introduced, arguably as the most appropriate basis to address this important issue of concurrent accessibility, in order to prevent segregation of blind people in computer-based working environments. A user interface management system (UIMS) has been developed, called HOMER, which facilitates the development of dual user interfaces. HOMER supports the integration of visual and non-visual toolkits of interaction elements; a non-visual toolkit, called COMONKIT, has been also implemented for building non-visual user interfaces, and has been incorporated in HOMER.}

After briefly discussing typical HRI models and characteristics of human, we point out that learning aspect would play an important role for designing the interaction process of the human-in-the loop system. We then show that the soft computing toolbox approach, especially with fuzzy set-based learning techniques, can be effectively adopted for modeling human behavior patterns as well as for processing human bio-signals including facial expressions, hand/ body gestures, EMG and so forth. Two project works are briefly described to illustrate how the fuzzy logic-based learning techniques and the soft computing toolbox approach are successfully applied for human-friendly HRI systems. Next, we observe that probabilistic fuzzy rules can handle inconsistent data patterns originated from human, and show that combination of fuzzy logic, fuzzy clustering, and probabilistic reasoning in a single frame leads to an algorithm of iterative fuzzy clustering with supervision. Further, we discuss a possibility of using the algorithm for inductively constructing probabilistic fuzzy rule base in a learning system of a smart home. Finally, we propose a life-long learning system architecture for the HRI type of human-in-the-loop systems.}

In this position paper, we discuss the impact on optical networks of all major classes of disaster events mentioned above, and we overview recent relevant techniques that have been proposed to increase the disaster resilience of optical networks against the various classes of disaster events. We start by presenting some proactive methods to be applied before the occurrence of a disaster. Then we move our focus also on other preparedness methods that can be executed in the (typically short) time frame between the occurrence of an early alert of an incoming disaster and the time a disaster actually hits the network. Finally, we discuss reactive procedures that allow performing post-disaster recovery operations effectively. The analysis of disaster resilience mechanisms provided in this paper covers both wired and optical wireless communication infrastructures and also contains explicit remarks covering the role of emerging technologies (e.g., fixed-mobile convergence in the 5G era and beyond) in disaster resilience.}

This chapter focuses on the importance and role of human factors specialists in the design of human-computer systems. This chapter has several purposes: (1) to introduce the field of human factors, also known as “ergonomics,” (2) to describe the role and importance of human factors specialists in the design and development of human-computer systems, and (3) to describe several of the key methodologies used by human factors specialists. A brief overview of the discipline of human factors is presented as a background for those unfamiliar with the field. The relation between user interface design and usability is discussed and an overview of general principles for designing usable systems and the type of information that is relevant for user interface design is presented. Models of the software development process are described. They present a framework for a discussion of the roles of the human factors specialist on design and development teams and the specific human factors activities that should be integrated into the development process. Task analysis, user interface prototyping, and usability testing-key methodologies used by human factors specialists are described and; the importance and the complexities of designing for consistency from the user's perspective are discussed. Because the value of having a human factors specialist on the design and development team is often not understood and the associated costs are often regarded as too high, the chapter cover the reasons it is beneficial to have a human factors specialist on the team and the benefits—relative to the costs—of investing in human factors activities to ensure excellent user interface design.}

The advancements in distributed computing have made it possible to follow a service oriented approach, taking advantage of the benefits this provides. In this context, applications consist of soft real-time critical application service components that interact with each other to provide the corresponding application functionality, forming application workflows. In this paper we present a new architectural design and implementation of a Workflow Management approach. This approach covers enacting soft real-time application service components according to a workflow description language, synchronizing the application components, monitoring the execution and reacting to events within a distributed virtualized environment. We also demonstrate the operation of the implemented mechanism and evaluate its effectiveness using an application scenario with soft real-time interactivity characteristics, namely Film post-production, under realistic settings.}

abstract = {In the last decades there has been a tremendous increase in demand for Assistive Technologies (AT) useful to overcome functional limitations of individuals and to improve their quality of life. As a consequence, different research papers addressing the development of assistive technologies have appeared into the literature pushing the need to organize and categorize them taking into account the application assistive aims. Several surveys address the categorization problem for works concerning a specific need, hence giving the overview on the state of the art technologies supporting the related function for the individual. Unfortunately, this “user-need oriented” way of categorization considers each technology as a whole and then a deep and critical explanation of the technical knowledge used to build the operative tasks as well as a discussion on their cross-contextual applicability is completely missing making thus existing surveys unlikely to be technically inspiring for functional improvements and to explore new technological frontiers. To overcome this critical drawback, in this paper an original “task oriented” way to categorize the state of the art of the AT works has been introduced: it relies on the split of the final assistive goals into tasks that are then used as pointers to the works in literature in which each of them has been used as a component. In particular this paper concentrates on a set of cross-application Computer Vision tasks that are set as the pivots to establish a categorization of the AT already used to assist some of the user’s needs. For each task the paper analyzes the Computer Vision algorithms recently involved in the development of AT and, finally, it tries to catch a glimpse of the possible paths in the short and medium term that could allow a real improvement of the assistive outcomes. The potential impact on the assessment of AT considering users, medical, economical and social perspective is also addressed.}

A well-defined procedure for generating the “best” design and attaining a sound and complete system logical specification is the main practical contribution. The methodology has several years of successful testing by many people in practice. The use of computerized techniques in supporting the systems logical design process is also reported.}

The conditions for G2 continuity to connect two Bézier patches were studied and methods have been developed to ensure it. However, they have some restrictions on the shapes of patches of the Bézierpatch formulation. Gregory patch is a kind of free-form surface patch which is extended from Bézier patch so that four first derivatives on its boundary curves can be specified without restrictions of the compatibility condition. Several types of Gregory patches have been developed for intergral, rational, and NURBS boundary curves. In this paper, we propose some intergral boundary Gregorytype patches bounded by cubic and quartic curves for G2 continuity.}

abstract = {Operations that create additive or subtractive volume features, such as bosses or slots, simplify the computer aided design of mechanical parts. Surface features, whether extracted automatically or selected interactively, group functionally related boundary elements, and thus provide an expedient interface between CAD systems and analysis or manufacturing applications. Despite much progress in CAD, design remains an iterative process and involves error-prone modifications of previous solutions. Features should in principle offer a high level vocabulary for characterizing errors and for specifying how they should be corrected. This paper points out the semantic ambiguities of simplistic feature-based commands for editing models. It recommends procedural models for editing volume features, and corrective volumes for editing surface features. It shows how space decomposition techniques and CSG expressions based on active zones reduce the cost of executing an editing command. Error detection may be automated by supporting intentional features, which correspond to the desired characteristics of the model, and by endowing them with domain dependent validity criteria expressed in terms of associated geometric elements. The paper demonstrates that validity may be tested by simply interrogating a mixed-dimensional geometric structure which is used to represent not only the model, but also the interactions between the geometric elements associated with intentional features.}

This “quality loop” is subdivided into three steps—quality requirements, quality engineering, and characteristics—which will be positioned within a normal system development method. A practical application of this approach and the experiences obtained from it are described.}

abstract = {An algebraic specification concept for modules in software engineering is introduced which includes, in addition to a parameter and body part, explicit import and export interfaces. This concept integrates the main ideas of parameterized specifications for abstract data types and the information-hiding concept required for modules in software engineering. The concept is carefully motivated and defined with formal syntax and semantics within the framework of algebraic specifications. The basic constructions for combining modules are composition, actualization, extension, and union of modules with shared submodules. In this paper, composition and union are studied in detail. Both constructions are shown to be compositional. This means that the semantics of a combined module can be expressed in terms of the semantics of the components. To show the practical significance, specifications for the modules of an airport-schedule system and corresponding Ada packages are presented as an example.}

abstract = {Advancing our understanding about the human dynamics of cyber security is a major research challenge. At this point, it is unclear how cyber defense teams are organized and led in coordinating and working together to mount and conduct an effective cyber defense. Therefore, we do not know what makes a cyber defense team more or less effective in responding to and mitigating cyber attacks. Cyber competitions offer an approach to train and evaluate the performance of cyber defense teams; such competitions are now regularly conducted at the high school, college, professional, and military defense levels. These naturalistic exercises of teamwork for cyber defense represent an important source for understanding the way defense teams form, coordinate and organize, and to determine the factors that make teams more or less successful. For this purpose, we participated in data collection at the Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (MACCDC) to understand the key features of effective team processes defined by outcome measures of scored team success. We collected data from wearable social sensors to assess face-to-face interactions and using a 16-point teamwork instrument called OAT (Observational Assessment of Teamwork) to assess teamwork and leadership behaviors in cyber defense. Importantly, this being a cyber defense competition, the success of these teams is evaluated along three independent scoring dimensions: (a) Maintaining Services, (b) Incidence Response, and (c) Scenario Injects. Our results indicate that the leadership dimension and face-to-face interactions are important factors that determine the success of these teams. Teams with effective leadership were more successful, and face-to-face interactions emerged as a strong negative predictor of success. Thus, functional specialization within a team and well-guided leadership could be important predictors of timely detection and mitigation of ongoing cyber attacks. Future research should address more concrete aspects of team coordination and evaluation in cyber defense teams.}

abstract = {New product development (NPD) is a term used to describe the complete process of bringing a new concept to a state of market readiness. Mechatronics based product requires a multidisciplinary approach for its modeling, design, development and implementation. An integrated and concurrent approach focusing on integrating the mechanical structure with basic three components namely sensors, controllers and actuators is required. This paper aims at developing a framework for a new Mechatronics product development. For conceptual design of Mechatronics system, various tools like Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM), Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (FISM), Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP) and Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (FQFD) are used. Based on the prioritized design requirements, the functional specifications of the required components are developed. Then, Computer Aided Design and control system software are used to develop the detailed system design. Then, a prototype model is developed based on the integration of mechanical system with Sensor, Controller and Electrical units. Performance of the prototype model is monitored and Fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is then used to rank the potential failures. Based on the results of fuzzy FMEA, the developed model is redesigned. The proposed framework is illustrated with a case study related to developing automatic power loom reed cleaning machine.}
