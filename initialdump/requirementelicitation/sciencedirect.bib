abstract = {The concept of twinning an operational physical system with a functional replica is not new, having been practiced in the space sector for over 50 years. Advances in digitalisation have created opportunities to extract data, obtain insights and achieve greater situational awareness of a physical system’s performance. Increasing interest in the concept has led to a proliferation of digital twin definitions, which are used to frame discussions about specific digital twins. Consequentially comparison of the capabilities of specific digital twins is difficult as they are analysed using different definitions. This paper proposes an analysis framework that enables the characteristics of all digital twins to be matched to this framework. Using this framework, a digital twin may be characterised, or two or more digital twins may be compared. By establishing a framework that contains common functional characteristics, we aim to reduce the confusion caused by the plethora of digital twin definitions and their interpretation by suppliers. By focusing only on functionality and not addressing non-functional requirements the analysis allows comparison of different physical and logical instantiations of digital twins.}

These approaches have facilitated the development of promising tools for dealing with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This paper presents a novel system called CogniDron-EEG. This system is based on a brain–computer interface for flying indoor a drone for cognitive training purposes. We conducted a controlled trial with ten healthy children aged 7–14 to test the functional suitability and usability of the CogniDron-EEG system. Also, this study allowed us to evaluate the preference between our system and another system based on video games. Therefore, participant subjects used our CogniDron-EEG system and a system called Nexus to identify the users’ preferences concerning these two systems. The findings suggest that participants were satisfied with the CogniDron-EEG and provide the basis for further development and research on the CogniDron-EEG system. Therefore, the proposed system in this paper opens a new branch of research on drones to study their advantages and disadvantages of using them for cognitive training purposes. Additionally, implications for developing human–robot interaction and serious games in the mental health context are discussed.}

While the Smart PSS concept aiming at data-driven innovation attracts more attentions, there are two major challenges in designing Smart PSS. First, available data from digital technologies are actually limited by technical, financial, and social reasons. Second, the context of applying Smart PSS dynamically changes, which makes designed Smart PSS unfit to the target situation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an evolutionary design framework for Smart PSS. Our approach is based on the service engineering research, which has been contributing to the design and development of PSS. The proposed framework consists of three conceptual spaces and three cycles. The main features of the framework were two design cycles; in-system and ex-system design cycle. In-system design cycle is a process of creating and applying human knowledge for making the most use of data collected by digital technologies. Ex-system design cycle is to adapt to dynamic changes in contexts of the applied Smart PSS. We examine how the proposed framework works for designing a Smart PSS, with a case study about the digitalization of a restaurant business.}

The main idea of the Naked world is that all the services which are currently provided by gadgets will be provided by the infrastructure, thus no gadgets will be needed to use any kind of digital services. When a user in the Naked world intends to use a service, the infrastructure senses the user, the nearby intelligent surrounding launches an interactive user interface, performs identification through biometric identities, provides the service, and then closes the session when the user finishes the job. Therefore, the Naked world comprises highly intelligent and context-aware interactive environments. The vision of the Naked world is an evolution towards a user-friendly and ubiquitously available digital services, which is naturally bounded by the technological advancement. Henceforth, this paper presents the essential technologies and functional requirements along with the current and forthcoming novel technological concepts and challenges for the realization of the Naked world.}

abstract = {Smart product service system (PSS) has become an essential strategy to transform towards digital servitization for manufacturing companies. By leveraging smart capabilities, smart PSS aims to create superior user experience in a smart context. To develop a successful smart PSS, customer requirement management from smart experience perspective is necessary. However, it is a challenging task to identify and evaluate diverse, implicit and interrelated smart experience-oriented customer requirement (SEO-CR) in smart PSS context. Hence, this paper proposes an effective methodology to elicit and analyze SEO-CRs. At first, a generic, two-dimensional SEO-CR system is presented as a basis to derive the tailored SEO-CRs for various smart PSS applications. Second, a novel HFLC-DEMATEL (hesitant fuzzy linguistic cloud-based Decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory) method is proposed to accurately evaluate the priority and complicated interaction of SEO-CRs, considering the hesitancy, fuzziness and randomness under uncertain decision environment. Some new operations (e.g., cloud total-relation matrix and weight determination method) and a cloud influence relation map are developed to fully take advantage of cloud model in DEMATEL implementation. Finally, a real case of smart vehicle service system (SVSS) is presented. The 18 SEO-CRs of the SVSS are derived based on the generalized SEO-CRs. By using HFLC-DEMATEL, some important SEO-CRs in context of SVSS are identified, such as autonomous and convenience. The finding of results can help designers make proper decisions in design and development of SVSS with a superior smart experience. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method are validated by conducting some comparative analyses.}

abstract = {Advances in communication and information technology have changed the way humans interact. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the technology for communication has caused depression and anxiety, including among children and teens. Depression among children and teens may go unrecognized and untreated, as parents and teachers may have difficulty recognizing the symptoms. COVID-19 has changed traditional learning methods, forcing children to stay home and connect through online education. Although some children may function reasonably well in less-structured environments, many children with significant depression suffer a noticeable change in social activities, loss of interest in an online school, poor online academic performance, or changes in appearance. Home quarantine has affected children's mental health, and it has become challenging for school counselors to predict depression in many children participating in online education. This study aims to design and develop a tool for predicting depression among children aged 7 to 9 years old by recording students' online classes and sending a note to the child's academic file. The idea of needing this tool arose as an output for applying the design thinking approach to the online education website during COVID-19. This inspired the authors to combine the lecture recordings and the prediction of depression into one tool. Image processing techniques are applied to generate the results predicted by the model on the collected videos. The overall accuracy for classifying depressed and not depressed videos is 89%.}

abstract = {Although companies systematically strive for a full digitalisation of their products and their processes, the design phase shows that the quality of models is very unequal. Indeed, detailed design benefits from much more sophisticated methods and tools than the specification and architecture activities. Although, we should note the recent paradigm shift from document-based to model-based systems engineering, these models, which are mainly static 2D diagrams, remain poor to facilitate design verification early on. Thus, to detect most errors during the design phase, companies have no other alternative than to wait up to the testing phase which occurs after several years of development for complex systems. Thus, we propose a user-centric computer-aided verification process to ensure that the design meets the requirements under realistic operational conditions. The verification process provides a progressive immersion into the virtual system before seamlessly transitioning to the real system. Our work is built upon state-of-the-art MBSE methods such as the Property Model Methodology, which enables systems engineers to co-simulate specification models and design models. We improve such MBSE methods by increasing the level of realism that experiences the end-user during the verification of a design by the original combination of Model-In-the-Loop, Immersive Model-In-the-Loop, Human-In-the-Loop, and Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation strategies. A robot arm is used as a use case to illustrate the verification process.}

abstract = {The trend toward smart production is omnipresent in research over recent years and there are different approaches how to making a production smart. One of these approaches is to enrich reality with virtual aspects. Alongside the efforts to make production smarter by implementing augmented and virtual reality devices arise the challenges like motion sickness, usability, the weight of devices, or simply the complexity of the implementation process. A forced implementation of smart applications could lead to the frustration of the applicants and ruin the fruitful ground for improvement. The right position for the implementation of virtuality measures as well as the right dose of implementation is essential for success. This paper aims to connect an existing comprehensive approach with the implementation process of virtuality in production and show that such a scientific-based approach supports such a task. Design science research offers an existing, well-elaborated framework for complex tasks and bears the potential to support a virtuality implementation process. This led to the research question: Does design science as an existing research framework support the virtuality implementation process in production? Design science defines the environment of application as characterized by people (in different roles and capabilities) an organization (with different processes and structures) and technologies (like infrastructure and communication). This environment could be seen as the production environment. Further, we do have a broad knowledge base due to the profound work of the academic community in the field of augmented and virtual reality and a huge methodological toolbox. The existing environment and knowledge base are the basements to create an artifact, evaluate, and reshaping it. With this paper, we suggest a design science research-based procedure to support the implementation of virtuality in production. Design science research comes out from information science and is more and more applied in other research fields. As a result of our work, we saw that following a structured approach like the design science approach has the potential to support companies to successfully implement virtuality measures in production.}

In this paper, according to the geometric features reflected in the data points, a method for calculating the tangent vectors at the corresponding data points is proposed for reference. And based on the constraints on tangent vectors (calculated by the proposed reference method, can also be given beforehand) and control points, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms-II, namely NSGA-II, is adopted for adaptive B-spline curve interpolation without knowing nodes and knots in advance. The resulting interpolation curve approximates the given tangent vectors and the data polyline, and it is more natural-looking, in general than those obtained by other methods.

There are many EM approaches and enterprise architecture frameworks were proposed recently. These cover different enterprise aspects, perspectives, artefacts and models with different qualities and levels of details. Yet, the imperative determination has overlaid the declarative exploration in EM as a necessity of the design effort. Rethinking the assumptions underlying EM should bring a new and different understanding on how EM can be tackled within the enterprise, in particular the joint development and optimisation of socio-technical systems. This paper discusses EM from a socio-technical systems (STS) perspective, and towards forming a new model of EM that is driven from STS theory and combined with STS practices. Then proposes a conceptual integrated model that incorporates the new concepts of STS toward building an EM framework for balanced socio-technical joint development and optimisation.

A longstanding technological challenge exists regarding the precise assembly design and performance optimization of large optics in high power laser facilities, comprising a combination of many complex problems involving mechanical, material, and laser beam physics.
Method
In this study, an augmented virtual assembly framework based on a multiphysics analysis and digital simulation is presented for the assembly optimization of large optics. This framework focuses on the fundamental impact of the structural and assembly parameters of a product on its optical performance; three-dimensional simulation technologies improve the accuracy and measurability of the impact. Intelligent iterative computation algorithms have been developed to optimize the assembly plan of large optics, which are significantly affected by a series of constraints including dynamic loads and nonlinear ambient excitations.
Results
Finally, using a 410-mm-aperture frequency converter as the study case, we present a detailed illustration and discussion to validate the performance of the proposed system in large optics assembly and installation engineering.}

Good maintainability design can save substantial costs and reduce incidents and accidents throughout the product life cycle. Therefore, maintainability should be given full consideration in the early design stages. However, the current desktop tools are not effective to aid in maintainability design. Virtual reality (VR), a state-of-the-art of computer science, generates a virtual environment in which the user can have intuitive feelings and interact with virtual objects. In this paper, an immersive maintainability verification and evaluation system (IMVES) based on virtual reality is proposed. The goal of the system is to develop a cost-effective, rapid and precise method to improve the maintainability design in the early design stages. IMVES enables the user to interact with maintenance objects and conduct immersive simulations. Based on the developed methods, the data generated during simulation can be gathered to analyze the maintainability status. A case study applying IMVES into an aero-engine project is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the system. Compared with desktop-based methods, the IMVES could provide a more efficient way to conduct a maintenance simulation. Furthermore, the credibility and objectivity of the maintainability evaluation are also improved.}

abstract = {Context
The participation of users in the design process is recognized as a positive and a necessary element as artifacts suit their needs. Two complementary approaches of users’ involvement co-exist: the user-centered design and the participatory design. These approaches involve learning process from users to designers and vice versa. However, there has no research in design of virtual reality (VR)-based software dealing with how the elaboration of needs is actually distributed in time and among users, designers and project leaders, as well as how it is actually supported by tools and methods.
Objective
This paper aims to observe, in a real design project of a virtual reality-based software, how the various stakeholders (users, designers, project leaders) actually participate by sharing and pulling pieces of information from the process of needs elaboration, and how these contributions evolve throughout the decisions made in the course of the project.
Method
Our method, based on the observation of the practices in collective design, allows us to collect and analyze the relationship between each possible action (e.g., elicitation), each stakeholder who initiates these actions (e.g., users) and each phase of the design process (e.g., evaluation phase), and the dynamics of the construction of needs.
Results
Our results detail how the elicited needs are dealt with by designers, users and/or project leaders: (1) we show a strong contribution of users in the design, compared to others stakeholders, (2) among the needs elicited by users, most have been validated by the designers, (3) some elicited needs could have been firstly rejected and finally validated and implemented.
Conclusion

This paper proposes an approach to generate and evaluate design concepts by integrating the extended axiomatic design, quality function deployment and design structure matrix. Different design domains are mapped for matrix operations to generate feasible concepts based on design criteria. A domain mapping matrix is built to determine technical measures, functional requirements and design parameters based on customer requirements. The proposed approach provides a structured method to quantify, validate and qualify design concepts. A case study of the design of a hand rehabilitation device demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

In order to reinforce and strengthen the understanding of Scrum concepts, professors should personalize the learning process, catering for students’ individual learning characteristics. To address this issue, learning styles become effective to understand students’ different ways of learning. In this context, the meshing hypothesis claims that when both teaching and learning styles are aligned, the students’ learning experience is enhanced. However, the literature fails to evidence support for the meshing hypothesis in the context of software engineering education. We aim to corroborate the meshing hypothesis by using teaching strategies matching the Felder–Silverman Learning Style Model in a Scrum course. Based on previous findings, we focused on the processing dimension of the model. To validate our approach, two experiments were conducted in an undergraduate software engineering course in the academic years 2013 and 2014. We provided students with a Scrum class by applying teaching strategies suiting students’ learning style. Test results corroborate that students’ outcomes improved when receiving the strategy that match their learning styles. Our data highlight opportunities for improving software engineering education by considering the students’ learning preferences.}

abstract = {Context
Requirements elicitation is a crucial phase in the software development life cycle. During requirements elicitation sessions, requirements engineers capture software requirements, and motivate stakeholders to express needs and expected software functionalities. In this context, there is a lack of extensive empirical research reporting the extent to which elicitation sessions can be influenced by participants' gender.
Objective
This paper presents our research endeavour to investigate requirements engineers' effort and elicited requirements' accuracy based on participants' gender.
Method
We conducted an experiment in two rounds with a total of 59 students who played the role of requirements engineers. In the first experimental task, the participant watched two videos where men and women stakeholders expressed software requirements. Later on, the participants specified software requirements in the shape of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and next they generated Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) from those models.
Results
We observed two significant differences. One between men and women requirements engineers in terms of dedicated effort during requirements specification: men took less effort. Other between stakeholders' gender in terms of accuracy resulted of BPMN models: models built from men stakeholders yield more accuracy. On the contrary, accuracy of resulted GUIs models did not show significant differences regarding requirements engineers or stakeholders' gender.
Conclusions
Analysing descriptive data, women spent more time both as stakeholders and as requirements engineers but their accuracy is better.}

In this respect, Industry 4.0 is all about information and connectivity. Mixed reality (MR) takes the data collected by IoT systems and helps workers by visualizing contextualized data in real time. Human-Computer Interaction research has shown that MR can be advantageous in various application scenarios. However, there is a gap between research and practice when it comes to real world scenarios. So the question arises whether MR is already suitable for efficiently supporting employees in their daily work in industrial settings. To answer this question, we examined two maintenance scenarios in the field of intralogistics: (i) the maintenance of roller conveyors and (ii) the alignments of containers in shuttle warehouses using the Microsoft HoloLens. This paper (i) describes the scenarios and the specific challenges they pose, (ii) presents the prototypes that have been developed, and (iii) discusses the results of user studies that have been conducted to evaluate the practical applicability by presenting inhibiting and facilitating factors. In summary, although MR technology itself seems to be very promising in the scenarios presented, further research on hardware ergonomics and intuitive interaction design is needed.}

This conceptual model is the input for a model compiler that can generate software systems by means of automatic transformations. However, in general, MDD methods focus on modelling the structure and functionality of systems, relegating the interaction and usability features to manual implementations at the last steps of the software development process. Some usability features are strongly related to the functionality of the system and their inclusion is not so easy. In order to facilitate the inclusion of functional usability features from the first steps of the development process and bring closer MDD methods to the holistic perspective, we propose a Usability Model. The Usability Model gathers conceptual primitives that represent functional usability features in a sufficiently abstract way so that the model can be used with different holistic MDD methods. This paper defines all the primitives that can be used to represent functional usability features. Moreover, we have defined a process to include the Usability Model in any MDD method without affecting its existing conceptual model. The proposal is based on model-to-model and model-to-code transformations. As proof of concept, we have applied our proposal to an existing MDD method called the OO-method and we have measured its efficiency.}

The question that motivates this study is: ‘is it possible to train industrial workers for what exactly is coming instead of preparing them for a large set of scenarios - even very unlikely ones?’. This work proposes: (i) a structured On-the-Job Training strategy for non-routine tasks, called ‘training-on-the-go’ or ‘prescriptive training’, according to which a Prescriptive Analytics module schedules the training sessions not long before the actual performance, but only when and if needed; (ii) a proof-of-concept of a game-based training system where virtual scenes and context of an industrial site are faithfully recreated thanks to digital twin data and models; (iii) the use of evolutionary-based fuzzy cognitive maps (E-FCM) for the extraction of the workers’ implicit procedural knowledge and for the comparison of mental models of experienced vs. inexperienced workers to assess potential misconceptions or flaws in their decision-making process. This work contributes to the evolution of worker training paradigms and systems from the perspective of human-centric cyber-physical production systems and aims for current gaps in workforce training, i.e. poor timeliness and effectiveness, limited context and industrial information integration, and scarce focus on the experts’ implicit knowledge. An application study with a non-routine task on an offshore oil platform demonstrates how the proposed system facilitates knowledge transfer, offers situational awareness and sustains the workforce competence development process.}

The workings of medical educational tools are implemented using a myriad of approaches ranging from presenting static content to immersing students in gamified virtual-reality environments. The objective of this paper is to explore whether and how different approaches for designing medical educational tools affect students’ learning performance.
Materials and methods
Four versions of an educational tool for the study of clinical cases were implemented: a 2D version, a gamified 2D version, a gamified 3D version, and a gamified immersive-virtual-reality version. All complying with the same functional requirements. Each version was used and evaluated by an independent group of students. The participants (n = 78) evaluated the applications regarding usefulness, usability, and gamification. Afterward, the students took an exam to assess the retention of information on the clinical cases presented.
Results
One-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirmed that the participants perceived that it was at least quite likely that gamification helped improved their learning. In addition, based on the participants’ perception, the gamification of the immersive-virtual-reality version helped the most to improve their learning performance in comparison with the gamified 2D and 3D versions.
Conclusions
Regardless of whether different versions of a medical educational tool (complying with the same functional requirements) are perceived as equally useful and usable, the design approach (either 2D, 3D, or immersive-virtual-reality with or without gamification) affects students’ retention of information on clinical cases.}

By offloading tasks to high-performance servers installed at the edge of the wireless networks, resource-limited MDs can cope with the proliferation of the recent computationally-intensive applications. In this paper, we study the computation offloading problem in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-based MEC system where the base stations are equipped with a large number of antennas. Our objective is to minimize the power consumption and offloading delay at the MDs under the stochastic system environment. To this end, we introduce new formulation of the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose two Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to learn the optimal offloading policy without any prior knowledge of the environment dynamics. First, a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based algorithm to solve the curse of the state space explosion is defined. Then, a more general Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based algorithm to solve the problem of discrete action space is introduced. Simulation results show that our DRL-based solutions outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, our PPO algorithm exhibits stable performance and efficient offloading results compared to the benchmarks DQN and Double DQN (DDQN) strategies.}

The methodology which is used in this research is experiment with the help of virtual reality to simulate virtual world of high places environment as the reality in the imagination of the user. The virtual environment helps the sufferer to reduce their fear of height in a safe and controllable environment. This research shows that virtual reality is able to mimic real high places and train the users to overcome their anxiety of high places. With virtual world, the users are able to confront their fear gradually based on the level progression in the virtual world. Thus, it gives the users more experience to handle their fear in the secured environment and gradually decrease their anxiety level of acrophobia.}

However, these approaches omit how to produce a good video. This missing guidance is one crucial reason why videos are not established in RE. We propose a quality model for videos representing a vision, so-called vision videos. Based on two literature reviews, we elaborate ten quality characteristics of videos and five quality characteristics of visions which together form a quality model for vision videos that includes all 15 quality characteristics. We provide two representations of the quality model: (a) a hierarchical decomposition of vision video quality into the quality characteristics and (b) a mapping of these characteristics to the video production and use process. While the hierarchical decomposition supports the evaluation of vision videos, the mapping provides guidance for video production. In an evaluation with 139 students, we investigated whether the 15 characteristics are related to the overall quality of vision videos perceived by the subjects from a developer’s the point of view. Six characteristics (video length, focus, prior knowledge, clarity, pleasure, and stability) correlated significantly with the likelihood that the subjects perceived a vision video as good. These relationships substantiate a fundamental relevance of the proposed quality model. Therefore, we conclude that the quality model is a sound basis for future refinements and extensions.}

Current definitions of mixed reality situations cannot cope adequately with this new class of experience. In this paper we name this new situation as “pervasive virtuality”, which we define as being a virtual environment that is extended by incorporating physical elements as proxy objects, integrating contextual information, and resolving conflicts with the dominance of a particular sense (usually vision). This new mixed reality paradigm is not well understood by both industry and academia. Therefore, we propose an extension to the well-known Milgram and Colquhoun’s taxonomy to cope with this new mixed reality situation.

We present a literature review at the intersection between ED and DS, identifying the tools, algorithms and data sources that show the most potential in contributing to ED, and identifying a set of challenges that future data scientists and designers should tackle, to maximize the potential of DS in supporting effective and efficient designs. A rigorous scoping review approach has been supported by Natural Language Processing techniques, in order to offer a review of research across two fuzzy-confining disciplines. The paper identifies challenges related to the two fields of research and to their interfaces. The main gaps in the literature revolve around the adaptation of computational techniques to be applied in the peculiar context of design, the identification of data sources to boost design research and a proper featurization of this data. The challenges have been classified considering their impacts on ED phases and applicability of DS methods, giving a map for future research across the fields. The scoping review shows that to fully take advantage of DS tools there must be an increase in the collaboration between design practitioners and researchers in order to open new data driven opportunities.}

We model the shaping of a pot as a gradual and progressive convergence of the pot-profile to the shape of the user׳s hand represented as a point-cloud (PCL). Our pottery-inspired application served as a platform for systematically revealing how users use their hands to express the intent of deformation during a pot shaping process. Our approach involved three stages: (a) clutching by proximal-attraction, (b) shaping by proximal-attraction, and (c) shaping by grasp+motion. The design and implementation of each stage was informed by user evaluations of the previous stage. Our work evidently demonstrates that it is possible to enable users to express their intent for shape deformation without the need for a fixed set of gestures for clutching and deforming a shape. We found that the expressive capability of hand articulation can be effectively harnessed for controllable shaping by organizing the deformation process in broad classes of intended operations such as pulling, pushing, and fairing. After minimal practice with the pottery application, users could figure out their own strategy for reaching, grasping, and deforming the pot. Users particularly enjoyed using day-to-day physical objects as tools for shaping pots.}

While common information gathering approaches are generally efficacious, they can be quite time consuming and have the risk of developing inaccuracies when information is forgotten or incorrectly interpreted by analysts. In this study, the potential of a role-playing approach to process elicitation and specification has been examined. This method allows stakeholders to enter a virtual world and role-play actions similarly to how they would in reality. As actions are completed, a model is automatically developed, removing the need for stakeholders to learn and understand a modelling grammar. An empirical investigation comparing both the modelling outputs and participant behaviour of this virtual world role-play elicitor with an S-BPM process modelling tool found that while the modelling approaches of the two groups varied greatly, the virtual world elicitor may not only improve both the number of individual process task steps remembered and the correctness of task ordering, but also provide a reduction in the time required for stakeholders to model a process view.}

abstract = {Progressive digitization in the development phase of systems is leading to shorter development times and lower costs. At the same time, the interactions in more complex systems are increasing and become more nested, which affects the understanding of system dependencies for humans as well as modeling these. This results in the challenge of digitizing the knowledge (rules, regulations, requirements, etc.) required to describe the system and its interrelationships. An example of such a system is the aircraft. In practice, usually, the technical design of the cabin and its systems is done separately from the preliminary aircraft design and the cabin results will be integrated late in the aircraft development process. In this paper, a proposal is given for a conceptual design method that enables a cabin systems layout based on preliminary aircraft design data (parameter set). Therefore, a central data model is developed that links cabin components to several disciplines to enable an automated layout. Here, knowledge is stored in an ontology. Linking the ontology with design rules and importing external parameters, missing information needed for preliminary design of cabin systems can be generated. The design rules are based on requirements, safety regulations as well as expert knowledge for design interpretation that has been collected and formalized. Using the ontology, an XML data structure can be instantiated which contains all information about properties, system relationships and requirements. So, the metadata and results of heterogenous domain-specific models and software tools are accessible for all experts of the layout process in a holistic manner and ensure data consistency. Using this XML data structure, a 3D virtual cabin mockup is created in which users have the possibility to interact with cabin modules and system components via controllers. This virtual development platform enables an interaction with complex product data sets like the XML file by visualizing metadata and analysis results along with the cabin geometry, making it even better comprehensible and processable for humans. So, various new cabin system designs can be iterated, evaluated, and optimized at low cost before the concepts are validated in a real prototype. For this, the virtual environment provides a platform that integrates all related disciplines, experts, research partners or the entire supply chain to improve communication among all stakeholders by directly participating and intervening in the evaluation and optimization process. Moreover, the use of VR is being investigated as a new technology in pre-design phase to exploit the potential of knowledge acquisition in immersive environments early in the development stage.}

The impacts of this paradigm shift on the human operators who continue to work alongside and symbiotically with these technologies in the industry bring with it novel ethical issues. Therefore, how to design these technologies for human values becomes the critical area of intervention. This paper takes up the case study of robotic AI-based assistance systems to explore the potential value implications that emerge due to current design practices and use. The design methodology known as Value Sensitive Design (VSD) is proposed as a sufficient starting point for designing these technologies for human values to address these issues.}

This study investigates the potentials of emerging computing paradigms and proposes a novel mobile edge-based hierarchical architecture to optimize m-learning performance efficiency. The architecture's design follows the ETSI MEC ISG framework and ISG MEC technical requirements. An m-learning use case was executed to evaluate the architecture's performance efficiency in a university facility. The implementation results show reduced latencies and quick response time. The architecture handles data locally on-site, lowers demand on radio access bandwidth, increases confidential data privacy, and continues the application execution even the network is disrupted. The architecture is open to redesign, reconfigure, and integrate with other computing paradigms. IoT-based m-learning use cases should be considered by reflecting learners' scaling of resource needs. Execution of complex use cases will expand the architecture base, MEC-based learning models usage, and change learning-teaching dynamics across educational disciplines.}

As a result, the effectiveness of tradespace exploration techniques is limited by its size and internal ordering. Therefore, we suggest that there exist models to elicit and use requirements that, for a given set older needs, could facilitate the maximization of the solutionof stakehspace so that the probability of finding more affordable solutions during tradespace exploration is also maximized.The present research proposes a mathematical model of the requirements elicitation process that facilitates defining performance objectives for the requirements elicitation process in striving for system affordability. The uniqueness of this research lays on two elements. First, the requirements elicitation process is mathematically modeled so that their objectives with respect to the effects on the solution space can be mathematically, and thus rigorously, described. Second, the system of interest focuses on the definition of the solutionspace as a driver for system affordability instead of on its actual exploration. The present research closes therefore the loop between stakeholder needs, system requirements, solutionspaces, and system affordability. The results of the present research are generalized to discrete requirements, fuzzy requirements, and continuous requirements or value functions.}

The former promises to increase the performance of several applications by using data locality and relieve the core network by addressing the increasing bandwidth demands caused by increased data volume. The latter makes the content directly addressable and routable in the network. Enabling ICN with edge computing in Radio Access Network (RAN) can improve the efficiency of content distribution and communication performance by reducing the distance between users and services. In line with this assertion, in this paper, we propose an ICN-capable RAN architecture for 5G edge computing environments that offers device to device communication and ICN application layer support at base stations. Moreover, ICN and edge caching is only useful for static content-requests for dynamic content have to traverse the core network increasing the latency in 5G networks. To address this issue, we provide a content prefetching strategy based on ICN naming. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme results in high cache hit ratios and lower delays compared to conventional edge systems and prior work on ICN for 5G.}

We used a three phase iterative user-centered study spread over 16 months. At each phase, the usability evaluation included several methods (observations, questionnaires, and follow-up discussions with participants) to collect quantitative and qualitative data in order to improve the current prototype and evolve to the next prototype.
Results
In total, 48 healthcare professionals (25 general practitioners and 23 hospital clinicians) participated to the MedRec app evaluation. There were 14, 32 and 5 participants for phases 1, 2 and 3 respectively. At each phase, many design modifications were done to strengthen usability. Concerning usability, participants considered the prototypes as an acceptable interface with a median System Usability Score of 73 at phase 2 and 75 at phase 3. Participants emphasized the need for improvements concerning workflow integration, usefulness and interoperability.
Conclusion
The MedRec app was perceived as being useful, usable and satisfying. However, further improvements are required in several usability aspects. Our study demonstrates the importance of conducting usability assessments before investing time and resources in a large study evaluating the effect of an eMedRec approach on clinical outcomes. Our findings may also increase the chances of acceptability and sustained use over time by clinicians.}

abstract = {In the current “mass customization” scenario, product complexity is increasing significantly due to the necessity to answer as quickly and effectively as possible to many different costumer needs but maintaining costs under control. In this scenario, requirements management becomes a fundamental features for the entire product lifecycle, as enterprises need to have a complete and clear idea of the market for succeeding in developing and supporting the right and innovative product. Moreover, considering that product lifecycle is characterized by many “trade-off”, so that product features are often negotiated in order to fulfil to conflicting requirements, it is important to support the “traceability” of the entire lifecycle “negotiation” process. For this reason, PLM platform has to provide suitable methodologies and tools able to efficiently support the design and management of large set of complex requirements. Requirements Management Tools (RMt) embedded in PLM solutions help keeping specifications consistent, up-to-date, and accessible. At present, there are different possible solutions, but a shared PLM integrated seems not to be available. In order to fill this gap, this paper has developed an user-based strategy, based on Kano methodology, so on “user satisfaction”, in order to define a structured set of guidelines to support the design of the features of an integrated PLM requirement management tool.}

It is intended, using three different organizational contexts, to initiate the conceptualization of a platform that makes use of data from different sources and that aggregates them converging in human resource management KPIs.

Though there is much research on customer-centric innovation and affective product design, designing a novel and innovative product that appeals to customers remains difficult. This is not only due to the difficulty of knowing a customer's preference, enabling the product functionality, etc., but it is also very complex to optimize both the technical and aesthetical design factors and parameters for a group of customers. The technical design specification is one of the critical aspects in designing innovative technological products. In fact, a similar group of target customers usually has hidden preferences that provide us with clues for identifying the design of a product. To this end, we propose a sophisticated optimization technique using the Hybrid Fuzzy-based Analytical Hierarchy Process and the Integral-based Taguchi Method called the Fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to determine the essential factors and design parameters in order to understand the preferences of customers and the technical requirements of engineers for designing the enclosure of a product. We demonstrate our methodology using the virtual reality (VR) Headset, which can be used for visualizing the metaverse in the virtual environment. The fuzzy MCDM approach suggested combines technical and aesthetical features to enhance the robustness of product design.}

Traditionally, content distribution networks (CDN) were used extensively to meet quality of service levels for IP video services. To handle the dramatic growth in video traffic, CDN operators are migrating their infrastructure to the cloud and fog in order to leverage its greater availability and flexibility. For hyperscale deployments, energy consumption, cache placement, and resource availability can be analyzed using simulation in order to improve resource utilization and performance. Recently, a discrete-time simulator for modelling hierarchical virtual CDNs (vCDNs) was proposed with reduced memory requirements and increased performance using multi-core systems to cater for the scale and complexity of these networks. The first iteration of this discrete-time simulator featured a number of limitations impacting accuracy and applicability: it supports only tree-based topology structures, the results are computed per level, and requests of the same content differ only in time duration. In this paper, we present an improved simulation framework that (a) supports graph-based network topologies, (b) requests have been reconstituted for differentiation of requirements, and (c) statistics are now computed per site and network metrics per link, improving granularity and parallel performance. Moreover, we also propose a two phase optimization scheme that makes use of simulation outputs to guide the search for optimal cache placements. In order to evaluate our proposal, we simulate a vCDN network based on real traces obtained from the BT vCDN infrastructure, and analyze performance and scalability aspects.}

Variant-Rich Systems (VRSs), such as Software Product Lines or variants created through clone & own, aim at reusing existing assets. The long lifespan of families of variants, and the scale of both the code base and the workforce make VRS maintenance and evolution a challenge. Visualization tools are a needed companion.
Objective:
We aim at mapping the current state of visualization interventions in the area of VRS evolution. We tackle evolution in both functionality and architecture. Three research questions are posed: What sort of analysis is being conducted to assess VRS evolution? (Analysis perspective); What sort of visualizations are displayed? (Visualization perspective); What is the research maturity of the reported interventions? (Maturity perspective).
Methods:
We performed a systematic mapping study including automated search in digital libraries, expert knowledge, and snowballing.
Results:
The study reports on 41 visualization approaches to cope with VRS evolution. Analysis wise, feature identification and location is the most popular scenario, followed by variant integration towards a Software Product Line. As for visualization, nodelink diagram visualization is predominant while researchers have come up with a wealth of ingenious visualization approaches. Finally, maturity wise, almost half of the studies are solution proposals. Most of the studies provide proof-of-concept, some of them also include publicly available tools, yet very few face proof-of-value.
Conclusions:
This study introduces a comparison framework where to frame future studies. It also points out distinct research gaps worth investigating as well as shortcomings in the evidence about relevance and contextual considerations (e.g., scalability).}

Moreover, the visualization of such models has been explored by some Augmented Reality (AR) systems capable of providing support to experts. Their compelling and appealing environments have also been applied to promote the social and cultural participation of general public. The existing AR solutions regarding this thematic rarely explore the potential of realism, due to the following lacks: the exploration of mixed environments is usually only supported for indoors or outdoors, not both in the same system; the adaptation of the illumination conditions to the reconstructed structures is rarely addressed causing a decrease of credibility. MixAR [1] is a system concerned with those challenges, aiming to provide the visualization of virtual buildings augmented upon real ruins, allowing soft transitions among its interiors and exteriors and using relighting techniques for a faithful interior illumination, while the user freely moves in a given cultural heritage site, carrying a mobile unit. Regarding the focus of this paper, we intend to report the current state of MixAR mobile unit prototype, which allows visualizing virtual buildings – properly aligned with real-world structures – based on user's location, during outdoor navigation.

You could also call it the reverse approach of Augmented Reality (AR). We see the main application in the medical field, for example with Highly Sensitive Persons (HSP). These individuals experience immense sensory and psychological overload. Due to the stressful situations caused by the disruptive stimuli, mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety disorders or somatoform disorders can develop and manifest. Up to now, there are only a few possibilities to offer help to these persons and thus prevent the symptoms. Therapies or participation in self-help groups can be mentioned as means of help. Interestingly, there are no digital aids for HSP so far, neither wearables nor mobile applications. By using Adjusted Reality, the aforementioned consequences should at best be avoided, or at least mitigated, by reducing the physical stimuli before they reach the sensory cells. The functionality of Adjusted Reality is therefore designed as an intelligent, AI-assisted and multimodal wearable system. Sensory input is personalized in the system, digitally modified, and delivered in an attenuated version to the sensory cells and finally to the brain. Through the use of Adjusted Reality, individuals are expected to relax and feel more comfortable with themselves, including their situation within society. In general, due to its omnipotent possibilities, Adjusted Reality can be relevant whenever physical experiences can be specifically reduced. In this work, these possibilities will be further explored.}

The realization of such high data rates is unlikely with the currently licensed bands in the spectrum. Therefore, it is clear that such high rates could only be achieved by employing more bandwidth with the state-of-the-art technology. Considering the fact that bands in the range of 275GHz–3000GHz, which are known as Terahertz (THz) bands, are not yet allocated for specific active services around the globe, there can be a true potential to achieve the desired data rates at THz bands. However, due to the characteristics of these bands, there are many open issues in terms of THz radio communication system design. In this study, open issues and the state-of-the-art solutions to these issues for THz communication system design are discussed. Moreover, standardization efforts up to date are elaborated. This study concludes that the actual implementation of fully operational THz communication systems obliges to carry out a multi-disciplinary effort including statistical propagation and channel characterizations, adaptive transceiver designs (including both baseband and radio frequency (RF) front-end portions), reconfigurable platforms, advanced signal processing algorithms and techniques along with upper layer protocols equipped with various security and privacy levels.}

Empowered with smart capabilities, smart PSS has great potential in creating positive user experience (UX). The requirements analysis is an essential task for successful development of smart PSS with strong UX. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the requirement analysis of smart PSS by incorporating smart-enabled UX perspective. Hence, this paper proposes a framework of user experience-oriented smart service requirement (UXO-SSR) analysis for smart PSS development. At first, the relevant factors (e.g., user personas and activity journey) are integrated to conceptualize the UX in smart PSS context. Second, a four-phase model is proposed for identifying UXO-SSR, which can provide an effective tool for acquiring UX requirements of smart PSS from holistic perspective. Third, a novel asymmetric trapezium cloud-based uncertain linguistic BWM approach is developed to evaluate the priority of the identified UXO-SSRs. The approach can appropriately handle the hybrid uncertainties (i.e., hesitancy, fuzziness and randomness) of linguistic evaluation information, thereby improving the accuracy of evaluation results. Finally, a case study of smart sleep service system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed framework.}

Project management (PM) applications have been adopted by PBOs with success, mostly at the project level. More innovation-oriented PBOs are keen to experiment and adopt a range of different project supporting applications to optimize several aspects of project management, resulting in “ecosystems” of PM related applications.

The main conclusion is that the requirements elicitation and negotiation are as important as the management of change regarding processes and individual practices.}

abstract = {Context
When playing a co-operative game, being aware of your collaborators (where they are playing, what they are doing, the abilities they have, etc.) is essential for achieving the game's goals. This led to the definition of Gamespace Awareness in order to guide in the identification of the awareness needs in the form of a compilation of the awareness elements that a co-operative game should feature.
Objective
Gamespace Awareness does not establish how much awareness information players must be provided with. This constitutes the main motivation for this work: to assess the impact of different levels of Gamespace Awareness elements on a co-operative game.
Method
A multiplayer action game was developed that supports three different awareness configurations, each one featuring different awareness levels (high, medium and low). The impact of these awareness levels was measured as regards game score, time, players’ happiness while playing, enjoyment and perceived usefulness. Several techniques such as subjective surveys and facial expression analysis were used to measure these factors.
Results
The analysis of the results shows that the higher the awareness, the better the game score. However, the highest level of player happiness was not achieved with the most awareness-enabled configuration; we found that the players’ enjoyment depends not only on their awareness level but also on their expertise level. Finally, the awareness elements related to the present and the future were the most useful, as could be expected in a multiplayer action game.
Conclusions
The results showed that the medium level awareness obtained the best results. We therefore concluded that a certain level of awareness is necessary, but that excessive awareness could negatively affect the game experience.}

abstract = {As an emerging IT-driven business paradigm, smart product-service system (Smart PSS), which offers not only the smart, connected product (SCP) but also its generated service as a solution bundle, has become a vital research topic. Many research efforts have been devoted to constructing the conceptual design framework by considering SCPs and services simultaneously. However, the following critical issues in Smart PSS conceptual design have not been well addressed: how to improve the solution of Smart PSS in the conceptual design stage to meet user emotional requirements. Aiming to fill the gap, this work proposes a conceptual design method for Smart PSS from the perspective of analyzing user-generated emotions/feelings. Specifically, the relevant traditional products are identified, and their public review data is used to analyze user emotions/feelings in user-product interaction. Interactive emotion board as a new design tool is presented to organize the user-generated emotions/feelings, associated design elements, and the potential design points of the initial solution. And the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is utilized to evaluate the improved solution. To ensure the efficiency of the analysis process, the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm is utilized in the process of clustering product samples and Kansei words. A case study of smart electric bicycle service system (SEBSS) design is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Based on the case study, the proposed approach appears effective in helping with Smart PSS conceptual design.}

Targeting at realizing the intelligent manufacturing of buildings, the digital twins are applied to all stages of building construction, and the three-dimensional (3D) modeling is implemented. A digital twins framework in the construction field is constructed based on the building information modeling (BIM). From physical construction site entity modeling (PCSE modeling) and digital twins virtual body modeling (DTVB modeling) to virtual and real interaction modeling (VRI modeling), the digital twins process is fully applied to the various stages of building construction. The performance of the method proposed is further verified through the analysis of specific data. It is found that the model proposed shows better performance on the same platform and node compared with other models, and it shows the best scalability in the iterative calculation test on the Flink platform through efficient memory management and incremental iteration mechanism. In addition, the model has a delay of less than 100 milliseconds: in the Sleep scenario, the system delay of the latest model is about 5 times that of on the Flink, and the system interruption probability will firstly decrease and then increase when the time division factor (TDF) is increased. This study provides important reference value for the intelligent development of the construction industry and the high-quality development of buildings.}

abstract = {Background
Machine learning-based beer bottle-defect detection is a complex technology that runs automatically; however, it consumes considerable memory, is expensive, and poses a certain danger when training novice operators. Moreover, some topics are difficult to learn from experimental lectures, such as digital image processing and computer vision. However, virtual simulation experiments have been widely used to good effect within education. A virtual simulation of the design and manufacture of a beer bottle-defect detection system will not only help the students to increase their image-processing knowledge, but also improve their ability to solve complex engineering problems and design complex systems.
Methods
The hardware models for the experiment (camera, light source, conveyor belt, power supply, manipulator, and computer) were built using the 3DS MAX modeling and animation software. The Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) game engine was utilized to build a virtual design room, design the interactive operations, and simulate the system operation.
Results
The results showed that the virtual-simulation system received much better experimental feedback, which facilitated the design and manufacture of a beer bottle-defect detection system. The specialized functions of the functional modules in the detection system, including a basic experimental operation menu, power switch, image shooting, image processing, and manipulator grasping, allowed students (or virtual designers) to easily build a detection system by retrieving basic models from the model library, and creating the beer-bottle transportation, image shooting, image processing, defect detection, and defective-product removal. The virtual simulation experiment was completed with image processing as the main body.
Conclusions
By mainly focusing on bottle mouthdefect detection, the detection system dedicates more attention to the user and the task. With more detailed tasks available, the virtual system will eventually yield much better results as a training tool for imageprocessing education. In addition, a novel visual perception-thinking pedagogical framework enables better comprehension than the traditional lecture-tutorial style.}

Hence, this article investigates the applicability of gamification through cloud computing and presents a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art gamification in education and learning. We also identify the subject areas that can be gamified and taught using the cloud service. The critical elements and minimum requirements necessary to gamify education are also identified.

Supporting such practices brings significant advantages to patients, their family, formal and informal caregivers, clinicians, and researchers. This paper presents a focus group with experts in physiotherapy and telerehabilitation, debating on the requirements, current techniques and technologies developed to facilitate and enhance the effectiveness of telerehabilitation, and the still open challenges. Particular emphasis is given to (i) the body-parts requiring the most rehabilitation, (ii) the typical environments, initial causes, and general conditions, (iii) the values and parameters to be observed, (iv) common errors and limitations of current practices and technological solutions, and (v) the envisioned and desired technological support. Consequently, it has been performed a systematic review of the state of the art, investigating what types of systems and support currently cope with telerehabilitation practices and possible matches with the outcomes of the focus group. Technological solutions based on video analysis, wearable devices, robotic support, distributed sensing, and gamified telerehabilitation are examined. Particular emphasis is given to solutions implementing agent-based approaches, analyzing and discussing strength, limitations, and future challenges. By doing so, it has been possible to relate functional requirements expressed by professional physiotherapists and researchers, with the need for extending multi-agent systems (MAS) peculiarities at the sensing level in wearable solutions establishing new research challenges. In particular, to be employed in safety-critical cyber-physical scenarios with user-sensor and sensor-sensor interactions, MAS are requested to handle timing constraints, scarcity of resources and new communication means, crucial to providing real-time feedback and coaching. Therefore, MAS pillars such as the negotiation protocol and the agent's internal scheduler have been investigated, proposing solutions to achieve the aforementioned real-time compliance.}

The Design Critique (DC) method is becoming more common in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX) studies as the need for new evaluation methods of emerging technologies is increasing. However, there is an clear lack of guidelines on how to conduct DC studies in the UX context.
Objective:
The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the DC method in the fields of UX. In addition, this paper aims to propose a generic process of running DC studies in the same context.
Methods:
We present a systematic literature review of the DC method. Moreover, we conduct a course of thematic analysis on the selected papers to identify the various DC processes and explore the following attributes: participant categories, data collection methods, and data analysis methods in each process.
Results:
We identified three different trends of DC processes: detailed, moderate and minimal. In addition, we proposed a generic DC process consisting of 10 steps divided into three main phases: preparation, conducting design critique, and pro-processing. We found that domain experts represent the majority of studies participants. Using interviews to collect qualitative data and using script coding analysis are the two most common methods of collecting and analyzing data.
Conclusion:
Conducting DC studies can improve overall systems usability by addressing design flaws at an early stage of development. The process of conducting a DC varies, depending on the project goals and states. The DC method aligns well with the small light-weight steps approach in Agile methods.}

Rules and requirements process management enables the unambiguous formalization of implicit knowledge contained in business rules, generally expressed in easily understandable language, and leads to the formal expression of requirements. In this paper, the requirements are considered a consequence of the application of a business rule. A conceptual model is then introduced, called DALTON (DAta Linked Through Occurrences Network), which supports this process. In this ontology, concepts and product data, coming for instance from an existing product database, are represented using instances and occurrences, connected together with triples built from business rules and requirements according to previous management processes.

It allows the elderly to get rid of the constraints of reality and perform social activities stably and continuously, providing new ideas for alleviating the loneliness of the elderly. Through the analysis of the needs of the elderly, a virtual social center framework for the elderly was proposed in this study. Besides, a prototype system was designed according to the framework.

Additionally, a test was jointly conducted with the chief physician of the geriatric rehabilitation department of a tertiary hospital. The results demonstrated that the mental state of the elderly who had used the virtual social center was significantly better than that of the elderly who had not used it.

This paper presents a Blockchain Technology (BCT) based solution to improve the security and privacy of VC based device data. The proposed design is evaluated by implementing an IoT based application in a virtual vehicle monitoring system. The technical information about the instructions to the vehicle (devices), authentication, integrity, and vehicle reactions are stored in a cloud platform wherein Pentatope based Elliptic curve cryptography and SHA are used to ensure privacy in data storage. The data is later stored in an Ethereum based public blockchain to enable seamless BCT transactions. This system uses the Ganache platform for BCT that ensures data protection and privacy. Furthermore, metamask wallet for Ethbalance is required to perform transactions over BCT. The proposed methodology thus helps to protect data from stalkers, plaintext attacks as well as ciphertext attacks. The results, when compared with the state-of-the-art, justify the efficiency and security aspects of the proposed approach.}

The aim of the paper is twofold. First, we present Starviewer, a DICOM viewer developed in C++ with a core component built on top of open-source libraries. The viewer supports extensions that implement functionalities and front-ends for specific use cases. Second, we propose an adaptable evaluation framework based on a set of criteria weighted according to user needs. The framework can consider different user profiles and allow criteria to be decomposed in subcriteria and grouped in more general categories making a multi-level hierarchical structure that can be analysed at different levels of detail to make scores interpretation more comprehensible.
Results
Different examples to illustrate Starviewer functionalities and its extensions are presented. In addition, the proposed evaluation framework is used to compare Starviewer with four open-source viewers regarding their functionalities for daily clinical practice. In a range from 0 to 10, the final scores are: Horos (7.7), Starviewer (6.2), Weasis (6.0), Ginkgo CADx (4.1), and medInria (3.8).
Conclusions
Starviewer provides basic and advanced features for daily image diagnosis needs as well as a modular design that enables the development of custom extensions. The evaluation framework is useful to understand and prioritize new development goals, and can be easily adapted to express different needs by altering the weights. Moreover, it can be used as a complement to maturity models.}

This paper presents a novel big data analytics framework for smart cities called “Smart City Data Analytics Panel — SCDAP”. The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches.}

abstract = {As the amount and complexity of software for automating heavy-duty mobile machinery is increasing, software engineering in this domain is becoming more important. To characterize the industry’s current state of software engineering and its issues to guide future research, we performed an empirical exploratory study. We interviewed 16 software engineering professionals from 13 different companies conducting business in heavy-duty mobile machines and their automation. The interviews were analyzed qualitatively, and quantification of the analysis results is presented. We first create an overview of software engineering in the heavy-duty mobile machinery industry. We then identify problem areas affecting software development and discuss some of the possible solutions found in literature. Our findings indicate that the major problem areas faced in the industry that require more research are its digital transformation, autonomous machine functional safety, low availability of workforce for developing software for robotic mobile machines and the lack of established software standards.}

Industry 5.0 is one of the recent terms to describe this phenomenon, defined as a humanized vision of technological transformations in industry, balancing the current and future needs of the workers and society with the sustainable optimization of energy consumption, materials processing, and product lifecycles. This paper presents a tertiary study of thirty-two literature reviews on Industry 5.0, supported by a bibliometric analysis in the Scopus database. The results show three stages of Industry 5.0 research since 2018, starting with the Industry 4.0 separation. The latest priority is to deploy circular manufacturing strategies supported by human-friendly digitalization capable of anticipating and acting proactively on impacts. Therefore, Industry 5.0 is future-oriented and cross-sectoral, (interactively) diverging from the original configuration of Industry 4.0. For theory, we highlight the findings of recent literature reviews, clarifying the landscape of Industry 5.0 research and suggesting future developments. For practice, this paper presents examples of societal priorities that industries should consider in their digital transformation investments, as crucial as improving economic competitiveness.}

In today’s Intelligence Age, some theoretical and practical studies have tried to achieve the advanced intelligence capabilities in DDPD. However, to the authors' best knowledge, there is still a lack of a holistic summary of DDPD with chronological concern in the intelligence age. To bridge the gap, this research undertakes a literature review of DDPD publications from 2000 to date (19/09/2022), of which 172 relevant papers are discussed via bibliometric analysis and state-of-the-art analysis. The results shown that DDPD has vitality in the Intelligence Age by combining the cutting-edge digital technologies, such as AI, additive manufacturing, digital twin, and so on. Moreover, current DDPD studies could outperform the classical design methods on the well-defined tasks, but it still cannot master the creative/innovative design tasks which require the cognitive capability. This survey further highlights several future research potentials including cognitive intelligence-enabled design, end-to-end design integration, advanced design knowledge support, design for additive manufacturing, and sustainable smart product-service systems. It is hoped that this work can be regarded as a reference to understand the roadmap of DDPD and offer insights for the design practitioners to complete relevant tasks in today’s intelligence age.}

abstract = {Product design is a highly involved, often ill-defined, complex and iterative process, and the needs and specifications of the required artifact get more refined only as the design process moves toward its goal. An effective computer support tool that helps the designer make better-informed decisions requires efficient knowledge representation schemes. In today’s world, there is a virtual explosion in the amount of raw data available to the designer, and knowledge representation is critical in order to sift through this data and make sense of it. In addition, the need to stay competitive has shrunk product development time through the use of simultaneous and collaborative design processes, which depend on effective transfer of knowledge between teams. Finally, the awareness that decisions made early in the design process have a higher impact in terms of energy, cost, and sustainability, has resulted in the need to project knowledge typically required in the later stages of design to the earlier stages. Research in design rationale systems, product families, systems engineering, and ontology engineering has sought to capture knowledge from earlier product design decisions, from the breakdown of product functions and associated physical features, and from customer requirements and feedback reports. VR (Virtual reality) systems and multidisciplinary modeling have enabled the simulation of scenarios in the manufacture, assembly, and use of the product. This has helped capture vital knowledge from these stages of the product life and use it in design validation and testing. While there have been considerable and significant developments in knowledge capture and representation in product design, it is useful to sometimes review our position in the area, study the evolution of research in product design, and from past and current trends, try and foresee future developments. The goal of this paper is thus to review both our understanding of the field and the support tools that exist for the purpose, and identify the trends and possible directions research can evolve in the future.}

Therefore, DT of the RADs’ industry advocates not only the design of products and functions, the more important is the management of service processes and resource integration. With the increase in the elderly and disabled population, the requirement for RADs is becoming more urgent. However, research on Smart PSS for RAD is still limited. The rehabilitation assistive smart product–service systems (RASPSS) was introduced into the development of RADs based on the “Design and Management of DT” strategy through the service design of assistive devices and user requirements analysis. Further, an integrated design of RAD and Smart PSS has been created, a development method of RASPSS proposed, the theoretical model of the Smart PSS based on RADs built. To specify the service framework, this case study discusses the development of a home rehabilitation assistive system for femoral stem fracture patients. This paper evaluates the usability of the system, the results of which prove usability and effectiveness of the RASPSS development method. The RASPSS development model is designed to meet needs of stakeholders, improve the user rehabilitation experience, promote the service innovation of Smart PSS, bring certain market benefits of rehabilitation aids and create social value.}

Nature holds huge potential for inspiring innovative design concepts that can meet the ever-growing need for smart products since biology perceive and interact with their living environment for survival. However, to date, very few studies have explored the application of natural wisdom in building innovative design concepts for smart products. This paper proposes a function-oriented design approach for smart products, by analogizing to biological prototypes. To do so, a unified functional representation, based on the Function–behavior–structure (FBS) ontology, is proposed to abstract biological prototypes, followed by a fuzzy triangular numbers-based algorithm designed to locate appropriate biological prototypes as analogical sources for smart product development. Moreover, functional innovative strategies and a hybrid design process are formulated to develop design concepts of smart products, by integrating several existing engineering design methods. Finally, an illustrative design case of a smart natural resource collecting system is used to demonstrate the workability of the proposed method.}

Different from other virtual pottery design systems, our approach simulates the entire physical pottery design process, such as modeling, painting, seals, firing and customization, and provides the ability to have the designed results fabricated by real artists or a 3D printer. To make the designed results manufacturable by artists, our approach imposes some industrial constraints (both geometry and decorations) when the user designs his/her personalized potteries. Our method only requires simple and intuitive interactions, so even novices can follow the workflow to create pretty potteries easily. We optimize the design process to perform real-time operations. Our informal user study shows that a first-time user typically masters the operations within 10 minutes, and can construct interesting and satisfactory 3D pottery models within minutes.}

Thus, game development projects use feedback from game testers to understand what they think of various features and concepts, to obtain a better understanding of problem spaces. This study proposes that game tester feedback moderates the effect of Sprint planning on game quality. A field study was conducted using a pair-matched questionnaire in which 102 game development projects participated. Results showed that Sprint planning has a positive effect on game quality. The results also revealed that iterative feedback has a moderating effect on the relationship between Sprint planning and game quality. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.}

To tackle these problems, a knowledge-driven approach was introduced to better organize the multi-source design knowledge and deduce service recommendations for personalized user demands. Specifically, a user journey map-based method was proposed for knowledge elicitation of the specific user demands. To organize the user knowledge for better understanding, hierarchical personalized user requirements (PURs) analytics were proposed to quantitively transfer PURs into proper design engineering parameters. To inspire the problem-solving logic for design solution generation, TRIZ inventive principles were retrieved and referred to. With the generated design concept, the service logic diagrams were structured to define the personalized service content of SCPs. Having the service logic and SCPs, the overall service network of the user-centric smart PSS can be outlined. The proposed approach was demonstrated and validated in the digital health area via a case study on smart test tube rack (STTR) design, and it was validated from an economic feasibility perspective. It showed that the STTR was promising to reduce manual work, improve the nurses' performance, and enhance patients’ medical experience. Furthermore, it was suggested that the proposed approach can effectively guide the innovative SCPs creation in a straightforward and instructive manner, and is promising to process the service solution deduction and improve the efficiency of service creation in real practice.}

Scholars are focusing on the theoretical architecture and implementing applications, in order to establish a high-fidelity, dynamic, and full-lifecycle DT model and achieve a deep fusion of real and virtual. As a typical complex system with multi-disciplines, multi-physics, and multi-domain characteristics, industrial robot (IR) involves various processes and elements from the two other levels of the system: components and production lines. Their complex relationships lead to a huge challenge to build a comprehensive DT model. Current researchers usually concentrates on single-layer services because of limited construction methodology, which results in enormous isolated models, and leads to low reusable system blocks, finite scalability, and high costs of design, adjustment, upgrade, and maintenance. To address these issues, a standardized methodology and a hierarchical, modular, and generic architecture are proposed to depict comprehensive and variable industrial robot digital twin (IRDT). Firstly, the ontology information model is presented by analyzing variable factors systematically. Then, model-based system engineering (MBSE) based methodology is introduced, including construction process and variants management. After modeling process of three levels (problem domain, solution main, and implementation domain) and four viewpoints (requirement, structure, behavior, and parameter), a generic architecture of IRDT is constructed and a feature-based variants management method is described. Besides, a six-axis IRDTS is implemented to illustrate the mapping of logical architecture and physical system as a multi-level elements and processes representation example. And the steps of numerical evaluations consist of system delay and derivation. Finally, results show the effectiveness and the potential of the proposed theoretical methodology for constructing IRDTS and other industrial applications.}

keywords = {Use case modeling, Belief, Uncertainty},
abstract = {Context
Latent uncertainty in the context of software-intensive systems (e.g., Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)) demands explicit attention right from the start of development. Use case modeling—a commonly used method for specifying requirements in practice, should also be extended for explicitly specifying uncertainty.
Objective
Since uncertainty is a common phenomenon in requirements engineering, it is best to address it explicitly by identifying, qualifying, and, where possible, quantifying uncertainty at the beginning stage. The ultimate aim, though not within the scope of this paper, was to use these use cases as the starting point to create test-ready models to support automated testing of CPSs under uncertainty.
Method
We extend the Restricted Use Case Modeling (RUCM) methodology and its supporting tool to specify uncertainty as part of system requirements. Such uncertainties include those caused by insufficient domain expertise of stakeholders, disagreements among them, and known uncertainties about assumptions about the environment of the system. The extended RUCM, called U-RUCM, inherits the features of RUCM, such as automated analyses and generation of models, to mention but a few. Consequently, U-RUCM provides all the key benefits offered by RUCM (i.e., reducing ambiguities in requirements), but also, it allows specification of uncertainties with the possibilities of reasoning and refining existing ones and even uncovering unknown ones.
Results
We evaluated U-RUCM with two industrial CPS case studies. After refining RUCM models (specifying initial requirements), by applying the U-RUCM methodology, we successfully identified and specified additional 306% and 512% (previously unknown) uncertainty requirements, as compared to the initial requirements specified in RUCM. This showed that, with U-RUCM, we were able to get a significantly better and more precise characterization of uncertainties in requirement engineering.
Conclusion
Evaluation results show that U-RUCM is an effective methodology (with tool support) for dealing with uncertainty in requirements engineering. We present our experience, lessons learned, and future challenges, based on the two industrial case studies.}

The working mechanism of modeling, simulation, prediction and control of machining process is described based on the interpretation of the modeling and application methods of machining process design, inspection process, fault diagnosis and quality prediction, as based on digital twin technology. Finally, key components of diesel engines are targeted as test objects, demonstrating increased material removal rate by 5.1%, reduced deformation by 22.98% and 30.13%, respectively, verifying the effectiveness of the applied framework and the proposed method.}

Optimal placement of the end devices to the most suitable access network is expected to provide the best Quality of Service (QoS) experience to the users but also the maximum utilization of the scarce wireless resources by the operators. Several on-going proposals attempt to overcome the existing barriers by enabling the use of Wi-Fis and femto-cells to cater for part of the load generated by the end devices. The evolution of the Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) for the core part of the cellular network, as well as the Hotspot 2.0 approach, are currently being subject to thorough discussions and studies and are expected to facilitate a seamless 3GPP-WiFi interworking. During the past years, several Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection schemes have been proposed. However, these schemes do not take into consideration the opportunities offered by these new standardized approaches. Our paper acts in a manifold way: Firstly, it proposes COmpAsS, a Context-Aware RAT Selection mechanism, the main part of which operates on the User Equipment (UE)-side, minimizing signaling overhead over the air interface and computation load on the base stations. Secondly, we discuss in detail the architectural perspective; i.e., the extensions needed in the network interfaces that enable the exchange of the required context information among the respective network entities and in accordance with the 3GPP trends in relation to the context-aggregating entities. Furthermore, we quantify the signaling overhead of the proposed mechanism by linking it to the current 3GPP specifications and performing a comprehensive per-parameter analysis. Finally, we evaluate the novel scheme via extensive simulations in a complex and realistic 5G use case, illustrating the clear advantages of our approach in terms of key QoS metrics, i.e. the user-experienced throughput and delay, both in the uplink and the downlink.}

abstract = {Context
In recent years, architectural design decisions are becoming more and more common for documenting software architectures. Rather than describing the structure of software systems, architectural decisions capture the design rationale and – often reusable – architectural knowledge. Many approaches and tools have been proposed in the literature to support architectural decision making and documentation (for instance, based on models, ontologies, or templates). In this context, the capturing, organization, and effective reuse of architectural knowledge has gained a lot of attention.
Objective
However, there is little empirical evidence about the supportive effect of reusable architectural knowledge on the effectiveness and efficiency of architectural decision making.
Method
To investigate these aspects, we conducted two separate controlled experiments with software architecture students in which we tested the supportive effect of reusable decision models in decision making and documentation.
Results
Our results show that the use of reusable decision models can significantly increase both the efficiency and the effectiveness of novice architects.
Conclusion
We can report, that our findings are in line with similar studies and support the claims regarding reusable architectural design decisions in principle.}

abstract = {For human-robot collaboration (HRC), one of the most practical methods to ensure human safety with a vision-based system is establishing a minimum safe distance. This study proposes a novel integrated mixed reality (MR) system for safety-aware HRC using deep learning and digital twin generation. The proposed approach can accurately measure the minimum safe distance in real-time and provide MR-based task assistance to the human operator. The approach integrates MR with safety-related monitoring by tracking the shared workplace and providing user-centric visualization through smart MR glasses for safe and effective HRC. Two RGB-D sensors are used to reconstruct and track the working environment. One sensor scans one area of the physical environment through 3D point cloud data. The other also scans another area of the environment and tracks the user's 3D skeletal information. In addition, the two partially scanned environments are registered together by applying a fast global registration method to two sets of the 3D point cloud. Furthermore, deep learning-based instance segmentation is applied to the target object's 3D point cloud to increase the registration between the real robot and its virtual robot, the digital twin of the real robot. While only 3D point cloud data are widely used in previous studies, this study proposes a simple yet effective 3D offset-based safety distance calculation method based on the robot's digital twin and the human skeleton. The 3D offset-based method allows for real-time applicability without sacrificing the accuracy of safety distance calculation for HRI. In addition, two comparative evaluations were conducted to confirm the originality and advantage of the proposed MR-based HRC.}

Compared with the traditional product service, the SPS have more complicated interactions between the service components due to the novel characteristics caused by the application of smart technologies. The SPS modularization presents great differences from the identification of service component, correlation evaluation and module partition with the traditional product service modularization. However, most the existing research mainly focuses on the context of traditional product service, while containing scant study of smart product service. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid framework for SPS modularization. In the framework, a cyber-physical product service blueprint is firstly proposed to represent the SPS operation process and identify the SPS components. Then, a rough-fuzzy correlation matrix is presented to determine the comprehensive interdependence between all pairs of SPS components with fully considering the hybrid decision uncertainties involved in the evaluation process, i.e., intrapersonal linguistic vagueness and interpersonal preference diversity. After that, the complex network theory is used to construct the SPS network and a modified Girvan-Newman algorithm is adopted for the SPS module partition. Finally, an illustrative modularization case of smart gearbox maintenance service and some caparisons with other methods demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach.}

Boundaries between devices blur with PC-tablet hybrids on the one side and wearables on the other. Future apps need to support a host of app-enabled devices with differing capabilities, along with their software ecosystems. Prior work on cross-platform app development concerned concepts and prototypes, and compared approaches that target smartphones. To aid choosing an appropriate framework and to support the scientific assessment of approaches, an up-to-date comparison framework is needed. Extending work on a holistic, weighted set of assessment criteria, we propose what could become the definitive framework for evaluating cross-platform approaches. We have based it on sound abstract concepts that allow extensions. The weighting capabilities offer customisation to avoid the proverbial comparison of apples and oranges lurking in the variety of available frameworks. Moreover, it advises on multiple development situations based on a single assessment. In this article, we motivate and describe our evaluation criteria. We then present a study that assesses several frameworks and compares them to Web Apps and native development. Our findings suggest that cross-platform development has seen much progress but the challenges are ever growing. Therefore, additional support for app developers is warranted.}

The emerging intelligent automation (IA) – the combination of RPA, AI and soft computing – can further transcend traditional DM to achieve unprecedented levels of operational efficiency, decision quality and system reliability. RPA allows an intelligent agent to eliminate operational errors and mimic manual routine decisions, including rule-based, well-structured and repetitive decisions involving enormous data, in a digital system, while AI has the cognitive capabilities to emulate the actions of human behaviour and process unstructured data via machine learning, natural language processing and image processing.

To remedy the issue, the Extenics theory is integrated with AD to provide improved guidance for design activity.

The consideration of adaptability in designing such systems is necessary in this unstable and volatile environment. There have been intensive efforts on solutions to make service compositions adaptable, but little attention is given to the evaluation of such adaptability. This paper proposes a set of metrics to quantify the adaptability of service compositions that are specified from the adaptive WS-BPEL-based frameworks. The metrics are based on two adaptability dimensions: the structure and binding variabilities. Structure variability, enables runtime changes to the composition workflow while binding variability, allows dynamic binding to concrete partner services. We evaluate the metrics through a case study, utilising variants of a travel booking process specified from different adaptive WS-BPEL-based frameworks found in the literature. The metrics are applicable to a wide spectrum of adaptive service compositions and their frameworks. A support tool is also developed to automate metrics computation. Through the metrics, adaptability of service compositions and their frameworks can be assessed and compared. This would facilitate design decisions in building flexible and robust services where adaptability is a first class concern.}

In this context, industrial research focused mainly on improving the manufacturing system performance, almost neglecting human factors (HF) and their relation to the production systems. However, in order to create an effective smart factory context, human performance should be included to drive smart system adaptation in efficient and effective way, also by exploiting the linkages between tangible and intangible entities offered by Industry 4.0. Furthermore, modern companies are facing another interesting trend: aging workers. The age of workers is generally growing up and, consequently, the percentage of working 45–64years old population with different needs, capabilities, and reactions, is increasing. This research focuses on the design of human-centred adaptive manufacturing systems (AMS) for the modern companies, where aging workers are more and more common. In particular, it defines a methodology to design AMS able to adapt to the aging workers’ needs considering their reduced workability, due to both physical and cognitive functional decrease, with the final aim to improve the human-machine interaction and the workers’ wellbeing. The paper finally presents an industrial case study focusing on the woodworking sector, where an existing machine has been re-designed to define a new human-centred AMS. The new machine has been engineered and prototyped by adopting cyber-physical systems (CPS) and pervasive technologies to smartly adapt the machine behaviour to the working conditions and the specific workers’ skills, tasks, and cognitive-physical abilities, with the final aim to support aging workers. The achieved benefits were expressed in terms of system usability, focusing on human-interaction quality.}

As it is difficult for system operation engineers to manually deal with such frequent and large-scale evolution due to problems of cost and efficiency, self-adaptation of the system is essential. In this paper, we present a programming framework for microservices (EPF4M) and an infrastructure for self-adaptive microservice systems (EI4MS) for the cloud–edge environment based on microservice architecture. Our study follows a “monitoring–analyzing–planning–execution” control loop that empowers the service systems to redeploy the services according to changes in the QoS. A two-phase strategy is adopted to minimize the side effects of the loop on the performance of the service system. A prototype of this framework and infrastructure has been open-sourced and verified through experiments conducted in a real cloud–edge environment. The results demonstrate the usefulness and advantages of our approach.}

Configuration is followed by a customization step, which assumes adapting or extending the configured business process based on the specific or unforeseen requirements. Hence, it is crucial to validate the correctness and compliance of the final customized business process with respect to the patterns and business constraints that are specified in the reference model. In this paper, we firstly introduce a technique to develop a customized process model and then present a set of identified inconsistency patterns that may happen during the configuration of a reference model and the customization of configured process models.

Real estate online platforms (REOPs) are getting more attention in the era of COVID-19, where the real estate businesses must run online, and the service users are pushed to a forced digital experience adoption. The users or consumers are not satisfied or happy with the current state of REOPs and often regret their decisions due to the poor quality of the web-based information provided on these REOPs. Based on a mixed approach of integrated KANO-SISQual, the current study develops a comprehensive smart real estate technology adoption model (SRETAM) to model the users’ perception of the REOPs in DDE. Data is collected through a questionnaire survey from 407 Sydney based REOP users. A total of 31 key factors are identified by reviewing 256 articles vetted by 12 local real estate agents. The results highlight 19 factors to be very important to REOPs users: reliability, the accuracy of the information, and credibility of the online platforms are the top three important factors. The hypotheses’ results show that all the SRETAM categories contribute equally to the users’ behavioural intention to use the REOPs and the KANO categories are statistically different. For KANO categories, eight attractive features are identified: graphical statistics, familiar web technology, content structure, web design, immersive content, self-efficacy, information novelty, and presence of 3D interactive models. Displaying the users’ location, learning tutorials, and hyperlinks to external sources on the web portals dissatisfy REOP users. The factors and their classifications can help the users get more features, verified, and transparent information for making better decisions in the DDE, whereas the REOP can enjoy more business due to increased service consumers. This can lay the foundation for transforming the traditional real estate sector into smart real estate in lines with industry 4.0 requirements in the DDE.}

abstract = {Cloud computing and edge computing have potent capabilities and value, and the combination of edge computing and wireless transmission has become a research hotspot, making cloud computing and edge computing adapt to broader application scenarios and exert more powerful functions. Due to the relatively large data volume of terminal devices in the edge computing network, how to process the upstream data stream and efficiently and accurately realize the wireless data monitoring transmission is a problem that the edge server needs to solve. This paper analyzes the interaction and cooperation relationship between levels, proposes a scheduling model and storage strategy for uplink data flow, and uses data flow scheduling and data flow hierarchical storage algorithms to optimize the edge system of data flow scheduling and storage. Combined with the attributes of the edge computing network system, the measurement indicators of the scheduling and storage of the terminal uplink data flow in the edge computing network are modeled and analyzed. We analyze the processing time delay, cost, and optimization target for optimizing the data transmission task. The simulation experiments prove that the algorithm in this paper has advantages in solving data transmission and storage problems in the network. It can reduce costs and delays, increase throughput, ensure monitoring node access delays, and maintain edge servers and disaster monitoring data centers.}

In this study, we propose and design a low-cost and widely deployable strategy for empowering emergency rescuers through an intelligent mobile psychological self-help tool. This tool will help reduce the gap between the limited number of qualified professional counsellors and the high demand for timely psychological support by rescuers. We start with a thorough investigation of user requirements, extant work, and relevant IS design theories to inform our system design choices, among which we identified that “virtual advisor identity” (VAI) needs further research. We then empirically examined how VAI influences the empowerment effect of ERMS. Involving 120 emergency rescuers who have just finished rescue tasks, our experiment shows that VAI has important effects on a user’s cognitive and emotional routes, which are significant empowering enablers that lead to positive empowerment outcomes. Interestingly, virtual peer advisor empowers users mostly through evoking emotional resonance from them, whereas virtual expert advisor is better at empowering users through cognitive channels. Important theoretical and practical implications of the findings are then discussed.}

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city’s IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future.}

abstract = {Product development based on a morphological matrix involves the process of decision-based design. Although the decision process can generate conceptual schemes under the guidance of qualitative decision objectives, analysis of the interactions among the qualitative objectives is seldom considered, which can lead to unreliable optimal solutions by combining conflicting principle solutions. In addition, due to the ambiguity of the constraints among the qualitative objectives, multiple feasible schemes with equilibrium states are not considered in the concept decision stage. To solve these problems, a decision approach with multiple interactive qualitative objectives is developed for conceptual schemes based on noncooperative-cooperative game theory to consider the tradeoffs among objectives (e.g., cost, quality and operability) using discrete principle solution evaluation data. First, the morphological analysis method can obtain feasible schemes and determine the principle solutions for each subfunction. Second, the principle solutions are quantified using linguistic terms. Then, the subfunctions are categorized through cluster analysis to determine the suitable principle solution. Third, based on the clustering results, a noncooperative game decision model is constructed to identify multiple Nash equilibrium solutions that satisfy the constraints among the objectives. Fourth, a cooperative game decision model is constructed to obtain the optimal scheme as screened by the noncooperative game model. The case study proves that this approach can choose a relatively superior scheme under the existing technical conditions, thereby preventing inconsistency with the actual design expectations.}

Workflow applications are highly used in IT industries, project management, supply chain management, large distributed management, and many more. Load-balanced workflow allocation to solve all the requirements of the cloud users is already proven NP-hard. In this scenario, meta-heuristic algorithms are one of the best candidates to solve the load balancing problem in the cloud to achieve an optimal allocation schedule. In this paper, we proposed a load-balanced workflow allocation method using stochastic fractal search (SFS) algorithms to maximize the resource utilization of the virtualized cloud resources. In this way, the load imbalance on virtual machines can be minimized. SFS is an evolutionary optimization method that uses the natural growth behavior in the search process. The performance analysis is conducted by implementing the workflow load balancer in MATLAB. The study shows that the solutions achieved by the proposed SFS strategy are far better than those obtained by particle swarm optimization (PSO).}

As a consequence, different research papers addressing the development of assistive technologies have appeared into the literature pushing the need to organize and categorize them taking into account the application assistive aims. Several surveys address the categorization problem for works concerning a specific need, hence giving the overview on the state of the art technologies supporting the related function for the individual. Unfortunately, this “user-need oriented” way of categorization considers each technology as a whole and then a deep and critical explanation of the technical knowledge used to build the operative tasks as well as a discussion on their cross-contextual applicability is completely missing making thus existing surveys unlikely to be technically inspiring for functional improvements and to explore new technological frontiers. To overcome this critical drawback, in this paper an original “task oriented” way to categorize the state of the art of the AT works has been introduced: it relies on the split of the final assistive goals into tasks that are then used as pointers to the works in literature in which each of them has been used as a component. In particular this paper concentrates on a set of cross-application Computer Vision tasks that are set as the pivots to establish a categorization of the AT already used to assist some of the user’s needs. For each task the paper analyzes the Computer Vision algorithms recently involved in the development of AT and, finally, it tries to catch a glimpse of the possible paths in the short and medium term that could allow a real improvement of the assistive outcomes. The potential impact on the assessment of AT considering users, medical, economical and social perspective is also addressed.}

Its application to architecture, engineering and construction, and facility management (AEC/FM) is straightforward and can be very useful to improve the on-site work at different stages of the projects. However, one of the most important limitations of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) is the lack of accuracy when the screen overlays the virtual models on the real images captured by the camera. The main reasons are errors related to tracking (positioning and orientation of the mobile device) and image capture and processing (projection and distortion issues). This paper shows a new methodology to mathematically perform a quantitative evaluation, in world coordinates, of those overlaying discrepancies on the screen, obtaining the real-scale distances from any real point to the sightlines of its virtual projections for any AR application. Additionally, a new utility for filtering built-in sensor signals in mobile devices is presented: the Drift-Vibration-Threshold function (DVT), a straightforward tool to filter the drift suffered by most sensor-based tracking systems.}

The majority of research to date emphasizes a high degree of anthropomorphism with respect to robot appearance and communication to support positive perceptions of robots. However, these features are often examined separately. As a result, there has been little evidence of possible interaction effects when implementing different design principles with a particular focus on matched features. An online survey with two different samples (sample 1: random; sample 2: healthcare professionals and trainees) is reported that investigate whether certain feature combinations are preferred for care robots. The attributes appearance (human-like, animal-like, technical), size (small, large), and communication (speech, sound, text) were combined. Results suggest that communication is the key determinant of robot preference. With regard to feature combinations the survey showed an overall preference for anthropomorphic features. Furthermore, the occurrence of matched features led to an additional improvement of preference ratings. Both samples provide similar results with high correlations. The obtained findings can therefore serve as a basis for the implementation of concrete design principles for social robotics in healthcare.}

As a service it must be assessed by customer's perspective, the end-user. They provide a bottom up evaluation approach of the system. In this work, these points of view are combined in a weighted model which uses the external quality characteristics and sub-characteristics of ISO9126 as a baseline for further decomposition into technical and user-oriented features.

In this study, a virtual watershed platform was developed and various implementation methods of flow visualization were assessed, such as scalar field visualization, vector field visualization, and visual water effects. In the platform, spatially distributed flow model results and georeferenced datasets are visualized in a virtual 3D environment. End users can conveniently explore modeling results within that environment. Based on analysis of the varying requirements of the flow visualization methods applied to watershed simulation, overheads associated with a user-determined switch between different systems were reduced, and the level of comprehensive information management and analysis of large volumes of watershed data was improved. This study shows that application of the watershed platform can enhance flow visualization in the water resources research community, and makes related water modeling more practical in support of water resources management.}

Recently, the language was standardised, but it continues being extended. Thus, we consider that this is an adequate moment to study how to support the proposals of the next iStar extensions. In this paper, we define PRISE, a process to support the creation of iStar extensions which is driven by model-based development concepts, reuse of existing iStar extensions and guidelines of experts. This process can be customised. We illustrate the usage of PRISE by recreating five existing iStar extensions. Finally, we evaluated PRISE with interviews and a survey with experts; and, we performed an interview to analyse the opinion about the usage of the PRISE to create a new iStar extension by a novice. The evaluation and validation indicate good results to avoid problems and increase the quality of the proposals and well receptivity by the experts and novice.}

At this point, it is unclear how cyber defense teams are organized and led in coordinating and working together to mount and conduct an effective cyber defense. Therefore, we do not know what makes a cyber defense team more or less effective in responding to and mitigating cyber attacks. Cyber competitions offer an approach to train and evaluate the performance of cyber defense teams; such competitions are now regularly conducted at the high school, college, professional, and military defense levels. These naturalistic exercises of teamwork for cyber defense represent an important source for understanding the way defense teams form, coordinate and organize, and to determine the factors that make teams more or less successful. For this purpose, we participated in data collection at the Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (MACCDC) to understand the key features of effective team processes defined by outcome measures of scored team success. We collected data from wearable social sensors to assess face-to-face interactions and using a 16-point teamwork instrument called OAT (Observational Assessment of Teamwork) to assess teamwork and leadership behaviors in cyber defense. Importantly, this being a cyber defense competition, the success of these teams is evaluated along three independent scoring dimensions: (a) Maintaining Services, (b) Incidence Response, and (c) Scenario Injects. Our results indicate that the leadership dimension and face-to-face interactions are important factors that determine the success of these teams. Teams with effective leadership were more successful, and face-to-face interactions emerged as a strong negative predictor of success. Thus, functional specialization within a team and well-guided leadership could be important predictors of timely detection and mitigation of ongoing cyber attacks. Future research should address more concrete aspects of team coordination and evaluation in cyber defense teams.}

Availability of Co-Gen loads and/or Electric Vehicles (EVs) enable these technologies to inject reactive power into the grid by changing their inverter’s operating mode without considerable impact on their active power operation. This feature has created considerable opportunity for distribution network planners to explore if EVs could be used in the distribution network as reliable VAR suppliers. It may be possible for network operators to employ some EVs as VAR suppliers for future distribution grids. This paper proposes an innovative Smart Grid-based Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO) engine, capable of minimizing system power loss cost as well as the operating cost of switched Capacitor Banks, while optimizing the system voltage using an improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) with two levels of mutation and two levels of crossover. The paper studies the impact of EVs with different charging and penetration levels on VVO in different operating scenarios. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates how a typical VVO engine could benefit from V2G’s reactive power support. In order to assess V2G impacts on VVO and test the applicability of the proposed VVO, revised IEEE-123 Node Test Feeder in presence of various load types is used as case study.}

abstract = {Due to the increasing competition in global markets, many European garment manufacturers have had to undergo significant restructuring and were forced to create leaner value-adding processes. As a result, the majority of the manufacturing operations have been outsourced to low labor cost countries. At the same time, production logistics as well as information and communication technologies have gained importance, in order to keep job functions requiring higher qualifications within Europe. Another challenge concerns the introduction of customized products into the production processes which previously had been designed for manufacturing of large volumes. Prior to implementing such changes, the consequences with respect to production logistics as well as the financial impacts should be examined. The case study presented in this paper uses a simulation tool for these purposes. Different scenarios developed for a garment company were analyzed. Based on the results, recommendations for the further development of the regarded company were deduced.}

One of these challenges is the increasing frequent adjustment and reconfiguration of production lines, necessitated by the diversification of customer demands. To improve the processing efficiency after production line reconfiguration, this paper puts forward a group learning architecture towards intelligent equipment. With this architecture, swarm intelligence can be accomplished through group learning. From the perspective of edge intelligence, this paper addresses key technology issues within the areas of data acquisition and preprocessing, cyber-physical fusion, knowledge extraction and sharing, and equipment performance self-optimization. The proposed approaches are much more useful for improving the processing efficiency of the reconfigured production line.}

abstract = {Visualization Environments (VEs) can assist construction professionals in studying intricate interrelations between construction equipment trajectories and their context. Such VEs typically support them in either reviewing earlier conducted work or experimenting with possible alternatives. In the first case, VEs represent equipment trajectories and their actual context sensed during actual construction processes. Trying out alternative trajectories in such VEs is problematic. In the second case, environments support experimenting with alternative equipment trajectories within an a priori defined context, but demand significant modeling efforts to reconstruct real-world projects. Although combining both functionalities within a singular VE will enable obtaining benefits pertinent to each of the visualization environments classes, such attempts were not made earlier. To overcome this gap, this study proposes a method for developing interactive simulation visualization environments suitable for both reviewing conducted and experimenting with alternative equipment trajectories. The suggested method concentrates on compaction operations and comprises two steps: (1) application of a “context-actions-trajectory-impact” framework to structure interrelations between compaction equipment trajectories and their context; and (2) operationalization of an organization scheme to devise a specialized VE with the desired functionality. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed method we applied it for the case of the asphalt compaction process. We developed a specialized visualization environment in consultation with asphalt paving professionals. Two test sessions with a paving specialist and two professional roller operators were conducted with the developed VE. The results from the sessions show that the environment developed according to the method offers the envisioned functionality. As illustrated by the test results, original and demonstrated equipment trajectories are commensurable and able to provide meaningful insights into compaction operations.}

We examine a complex industrial multi-stakeholder ecosystem of a port and observe that in the considered case study, the convergence of connectivity and data platforms enhances digitalization and helps to create shared local information between stakeholders. The research identifies a set of regulatory challenges for local 5G networks in complex industrial multi-stakeholder ecosystems where the telecommunication and information technology-related regulations meet with vertical-specific regulations, leading to a complex environment in which to operate. As highly country-specific, these regulations can open new business opportunities or significantly slow down or even prevent a market opening to local private 5G networks for vertical-specific use.}

The industry and the academia are embracing 5G as the future network capable to support next generation vertical applications with different service requirements. To realize this vision in 5G network, the physical network has to be sliced into multiple isolated logical networks of varying sizes and structures which are dedicated to different types of services based on their requirements with different characteristics and requirements (e.g., a slice for massive IoT devices, smartphones or autonomous cars, etc.). Softwarization using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)in 5G networks are expected to fill the void of programmable control and management of network resources. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review and updated solutions related to 5G network slicing using SDN and NFV. Firstly, we present 5G service quality and business requirements followed by a description of 5G network softwarization and slicing paradigms including essential concepts, history and different use cases. Secondly, we provide a tutorial of 5G network slicing technology enablers including SDN, NFV, MEC, cloud/Fog computing, network hypervisors, virtual machines & containers. Thidly, we comprehensively survey different industrial initiatives and projects that are pushing forward the adoption of SDN and NFV in accelerating 5G network slicing. A comparison of various 5G architectural approaches in terms of practical implementations, technology adoptions and deployment strategies is presented. Moreover, we provide a discussion on various open source orchestrators and proof of concepts representing industrial contribution. The work also investigates the standardization efforts in 5G networks regarding network slicing and softwarization. Additionally, the article presents the management and orchestration of network slices in a single domain followed by a comprehensive survey of management and orchestration approaches in 5G network slicing across multiple domains while supporting multiple tenants.

We propose a computational design framework for pose-driven automated generation of body-supports which are optimized for comfort of sitting. Given a human body in a specified pose as input, our method computes an approximate pressure distribution that also takes frictional forces and body torques into consideration which serves as an objective measure of comfort. Utilizing this information to find out where the body needs to be supported in order to maintain comfort of sitting, our algorithm can create a supporting mesh suited for a person in that specific pose. This is done in an automated fitting process, using a template model capable of supporting a large variety of sitting poses. The results can be used directly or can be considered as a starting point for further interactive design.}

While various frameworks have been proposed for designing semantic web services (SWS), few of them aim at testing. Objective: This paper investigates into the technologies for automatically deriving test cases from semantic web service descriptions based on the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) framework. Method: WSMO goal specifications were translated into B abstract machines. Test cases were generated via model checking with calculated trap properties from coverage criteria. Furthermore, we employed mutation analysis to evaluate the test suite. In this approach, the model-based test case generation and code-based evaluation techniques are independent of each other, which provides much more accurate measures of the testing results. Results: We applied our approach to a real-world case study of the Amazon E-Commerce Service (ECS). The experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Conclusion: It is concluded that our approach is capable of automatically generating an effective set of test cases from the WSMO goal descriptions for SWS testing. The quality of test cases was measured in terms of their abilities to discover the injected faults at the code level. We implemented a tool to automate the steps for the mutation-based evaluation.}

CVA, also know as stroke, is a serious global health problem, and can cause significant physical limitations to those affected. Computed tomography is the most appropriate procedure to diagnose and evaluate the dimensions and magnitude of a stroke. Thus, in this article we present an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the classification of stroke from CT images applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in order to identifying a healthy brain, an ischemic stroke or a hemorrhagic stroke. Following the Transfer Learning concept CNN was combined with different consolidated Machine Learning methods such as Bayesian Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines. Our approach contributes to the automation of the diagnostic process by a competent method that is able to obtain information imperceptible to the human eye, and thus it contributes to a more precise diagnosis. In addition, with the advent of IoT, a highly efficient and flexible new instrument emerges to address issues related to health care services and specifically in our approach can provide remote diagnoses and monitoring of patients. The approach was validated by analyzing the parameters Accuracy, F1-Score, Recall, Precision and processing time. The results showed that CNN obtained 100% Accuracy, F1-Score, Recall and Precision in combination with most of the classifiers tested. The shortest training and test times were 0.015 s and 0.001 s, respectively, both in combination with the Bayesian Classifier. Thus, our proposed approach demonstrates efficiency and reliability to detect strokes.}

To point out essential issues to be addressed, the paper proposes a PKM for Development (PKM4D) framework as a substantial extension of a current framework focusing on ICT4D (Information and Communications Technologies for Development). Closely aligned to Maslow's Extended Hierarchy of Needs, it allows for a differentiated assessment of knowledge management related innovations and interventions and their impact on six ecosystems related to technology, extelligence, society, knowledge workers, institutions, and the ideosphere. The framework is a spin-off of a design science research project aiming to introduce a novel PKM concept and system. The objective of this paper is to provide a motivation and more general narrative for employing the PKM4D framework in other developmental contexts in order to address opportunity divides independent of space (e.g. developed/developing countries), time (e.g. study or career phase), discipline (e.g. natural or social science), or role (e.g. student, professional, or leader). With a prototype about to be converted into a viable PKM system (PKMS) and in following up on prior concept and design related articles, the PKMS is not the prime focus of attention but serves as an example case of a novel intervention to be assessed and validated by applying the PKM4D framework and its twelve criteria.}

Thirteen non-academic projects were chosen because the HFE interventions involved changed the way workers work at their workplaces. Companies involved range from multi-national corporations and military organizations with thousands of employees to small trading companies with less than 10 employees. In 5 cases the HFE recommendations were fully adopted and well appreciated. In 4 they were largely ignored and not appreciated, with partial adoption and some appreciation in the other 4 cases. Three factors that predict appreciation were identified: (i) alignment between the benefits HFE can provide and the project's key performance indices; (ii) awareness of HFE among the client's senior management; and (iii) a team organization appropriate for applying HFE recommendations. Having an HFE specialist on the client's side can greatly increase levels of appreciation, but lack of such a specialist will not affect levels of appreciation. A clear contractual requirement for HFE intervention does not promote appreciation significantly, but its absence can greatly reduce levels of appreciation. These relationships are discussed using the Kano's model of quality. Means to generate greater appreciation of the benefits of HFE are discussed. Partial finding of this study was presented at the keynote address of the 1st Human Factors and Ergonomics Society of Philippines Conference held in Nov., 2012.}

abstract = {With the ever-increasing demand for personalized product functions, product structure becomes more and more complex. To design a complex engineering product, it involves mechanical, electrical, automation and other relevant fields, which requires a closer multidisciplinary collaborative design (MCD) and integration. However, the traditional design method lacks multidisciplinary coordination, which leads to interaction barriers between design stages and disconnection between product design and prototype manufacturing. To bridge the gap, a novel digital twin-enabled MCD approach is proposed. Firstly, the paper explores how to converge the MCD into the digital design process of complex engineering products in a cyber-physical system manner. The multidisciplinary collaborative design is divided into three parts: multidisciplinary knowledge collaboration, multidisciplinary collaborative modeling and multidisciplinary collaborative simulation, and the realization methods are proposed for each part. To be able to describe the complex product in a virtual environment, a systematic MCD framework based on the digital twin is further constructed. Integrate multidisciplinary collaboration into three stages: conceptual design, detailed design and virtual verification. The ability to verify and revise problems arising from multidisciplinary fusions in real-time minimizes the number of iterations and costs in the design process. Meanwhile, it provides a reference value for complex product design. Finally, a design case of an automatic cutting machine is conducted to reveal the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

It is expected that B5G/6G will push the existing network capabilities to the next level, with higher speeds, enhanced reliability and seamless connectivity. To make these expectations a reality, research is progressing on new technologies, architectures, and intelligence-based decision-making processes related to B5G/6G. Privacy considerations are a crucial aspect that requires further attention in such developments, as billions of people and devices will be transmitting data through the upcoming network. However, the main recognition remains biased towards the network security. A discussion focused on privacy of B5G/6G is lacking at the moment. To address the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey on privacy-related aspects of B5G/6G networks. First, it discusses a taxonomy of different privacy perspectives. Based on the taxonomy, the paper then conceptualizes a set of challenges that appear as barriers to reach privacy preservation. Next, this work provides a set of solutions applicable to the proposed architecture of B5G/6G networks to mitigate the challenges. It also provides an overview of standardization initiatives for privacy preservation. Finally, the paper concludes with a roadmap of future directions, which will be an arena for new research towards privacy-enhanced B5G/6G networks.

abstract = {Context
Collaborative computer games have evolved from single-player to massively multiplayer awareness-demanding games, usually involving collaboration to achieve team goals. As a consequence of such evolution, these players should be provided with awareness information that enables them to perform collaborative tasks with other team members.
Objective
The objective of this work is the analysis of current awareness interpretations in order to develop an awareness interpretation that collects the awareness needs of such games.
Method
This analysis has been conducted by means of a step-by-step Thematic Analysis of current interpretations that led us to extract the most relevant awareness elements defined in existing interpretations. The developed awareness interpretation was empirically evaluated by means of several surveys aimed at assessing whether the implementation of the interpretation elements in a game would improve the players enjoyment.
Results
The Thematic Synthesis Analysis concluded that none of the current awareness interpretations can deal properly with collaborative computer games, specifically due to collaboration and social & group dynamics. This Thematic Synthesis Analysis led us to coin Gamespace Awareness, a new awareness interpretation based on a combination of the previously analyzed awareness interpretations, which is suitable for collaborative computer games. The interpretation was positively evaluated for two games, namely a first person shooter and a real-time strategy game.
Conclusions
Gamespace Awareness combines the potential awareness elements needed for collaborative computer games, making it possible to identify the awareness requirements of these games from the very beginning.}

abstract = {We study the problem of finding entities referring to the same real world object in multilingual knowledge graphs(KGs), i.e., entity alignment for multilingual KGs. Recently, embedding-based entity alignment methods get extended attention in this area. Most of them firstly embed the entities in low dimensional vectors space via relation structure of entities, and then align entities via these learned embeddings combined with some entity similarity function. Even achieved promising performances, these methods are defective in utilizing entity contexts and entity topic information. In this paper, we propose a novel entity alignment framework CTEA (Context and Topic Enhanced Entity Alignment), which integrates entity context information and entity topic information to help alignment. This framework learns entity topic distributions from their attributes with a specially designed topic model BTM4EA, and the learned entity topic distributions are used to filter some weakly correlated entities for each entity to be aligned. Meanwhile, we embed KGs to low dimensional vectors space via translation-based KG embedding model and mine context information from these vectors with an attention attached Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). The entity embeddings, entity contexts and entity topics are combined to get the final alignment results. Extended experiments reveal that our method achieves promising performances in most cases.}

First, key game design changes of Pokémon GO are identified in the nearly five-year history of this game. Second, relationships between various system updates, design components in the game, and the active user level change are identified. Third, a theory of sustainable success is proposed based on the relationships identified. Finally, the “complete game strategy” has been proposed and detailed for game designers’ consideration.}

In proxy voting, each voter has the possibility to delegate her voting right to another voter, so called proxy, that she considers a trusted expert on the matter. In this paper we propose an end-to-end verifiable Internet voting scheme, which to the best of our knowledge is the first scheme to address voter coercion in the proxy voting setting.}

Today, the CX connects seven universities and research laboratories in five countries, managing 400TB of storage, of which 250TB are dedicated to CineGrid. All of these sites are interconnected through a 10 Gbps dedicated optical network. The CX distributed repository holds digital motion pictures at HD, 2K and 4K resolutions, digital still images and digital audio in various formats. The goals of the CX are: (1) providing a 10 Gbps interconnected distributed platform for the CineGrid community to study digital content related issues, e.g., digital archiving, the movie production process, and network transfer/streaming protocols; (2) building a tool with which people can securely store, easily share and transfer very high definition digital content worldwide for exhibition and real-time collaboration; (3) automating digital policies through middleware and metadata management. In this publication, we introduce the architecture of the CX, resources managed by the CX and the implementation of the first series of CX management policies using the iRODS programmable middleware. We evaluate the first phase of CX platform implementation. We show that the CX has the potential to be a reliable and scalable digital management system.}

abstract = {The global industry is currently facing a growing increase in the competitiveness that forces companies to adopt and develop new strategies and methods of production. Therefore, one of the most relevant challenges in manufacturing engineering is innovatively integrating Product, Process and Factory dimensions and life cycles, in a holistic approach, from design to recycling/disposal and reuse. The challenge faced here is the synchronization and simultaneous generation of all three-domain models by integrating manufacturing engineering knowledge into the early stage of the modelling and planning processes. The next generation of factories has to be modular, scalable, flexible, open, agile and knowledge-based in order to be able to adapt, in real time, to the continuously changing market demands, technology options and regulations. Therefore, integration, flexibility and efficiency requirements and the ability to simulate the production life cycle of a factory play a crucial role in decreasing ramp-up and design times. Furthermore they play a crucial role in improving the performance in the evaluation and reconfiguration of new or existing facilities, in supporting management decisions and providing tools that can guarantee real-time performance monitoring. Therefore, it is necessary to research and implement the underlying models and ideas during the foundation stage of a new conceptual framework, which is designed to be implemented in the next generation of factories. This will be supported by suitable Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and digital infrastructures and should lay down the foundations for future applications in this research area—the industrial paradigm of “Factory as a Product”. In line with the context presented here, we propose the development of factory templates to address the design and operation practices throughout the entire life cycle of the factory. Different dimensions of the factory templates are presented in this paper; they cover the design and creation of the factory, its remodelling and even the disassembly and recycling stages. This entire study takes into account relevant factors such as costs, quality, time, flexibility, environmental and social issues and energy efficiency. Throughout the article, different kinds of models are presented, which describe and adjust the structure of the analysis, design and development of a factory integration project that helps provide a formal analysis of the system. Furthermore, templates integrating the factory's response to internal and external disturbances will also be developed.}

This methodology reveals to be a promising solution for a cost–effective alternative in models construction.

However, the existing solutions are not flexible enough to provide high detailed models containing building interiors and exteriors.

For small companies, the largest percentage of software companies in Mexico, they are fundamental for their growth and survival. However, academic programs do not always match industry requirements. In previous studies, the curricula in Computer Science and Informatics, and Software Engineering, of 4 Mexican universities, were compared with two software industry standards: the MoProSoft standard, a Mexican standard designed for organizations having up to 50 people and the Basic profile of the ISO/IEC 29110 developed specifically for organizations having up to 25 people. The analysis of the academic programs showed a better coverage of ISO/IEC 29110 than MoProSoft. In this paper, these two standards are mapped to understand the results of the analysis in detail and provide recommendations regarding academic programs. The analysis provides an evidence that the processes of the Basic profile of ISO/IEC 29110 are better covered by the universities curricula because the processes provides the minimal set of practices to be performed while a project is executed from the beginning until the delivery of a software. In addition, this mapping presents a clear differentiation between these two standards that might help Software Development Centers to understand where to start in the implementation of one of them.}

Security techniques are not sufficiently effective to protect IT systems and most fail to address the correlation between actions and effects across multiple domains. In other words, identifying how actions performed in the cyber domain affect the mission goals is yet an unsolved problem. This research presents a potential solution and proposes a framework that links the cyber and the operations domains, evaluating how actions in the first impact the effectiveness of missions in the latter. The framework, Cyber-ARGUS, is a Command and Control (C2) support system comprised of a set of tools that provides coherent and consistent mapping between the two domains. Relevant information about the nodes of a cyber infrastructure supporting an operation is stored in a knowledge base, and then used to build a Bayesian Network that provides impact assessment. The technique is illustrated through the simulation of an air transportation scenario in which the C2 infrastructure is subjected to various cyber-attacks, and Cyber-ARGUS is used to assess their associated impact to the air operations. The main contribution of this research is the methodology that enables assessing the cyber impact to ongoing missions. One major advantage of the technique is that it achieves this by calculating the combined effects produced by the attackers and defenders plans, without the requirement of knowing the hard-to-assess enemy's individual actions.}

abstract = {Nowadays, mashups applications are growing in popularity. They are accessible by cross-device applications, supporting multiple forms of interaction in cloud environments. In general, mashups manage a huge amount of heterogeneous data from different sources and handle different kinds of users. In this respect, mashup User Interfaces are becoming one of the most important pieces in many kinds of current management systems, such as for certain geographic or environmental information systems working on the Internet. In this type of systems, the user interface plays a particular role due to the huge variety of components or apps that the users need to manage at the same time. However, currently, there has been scant attention paid to the management of the user’s interaction with mashups interfaces. This goal involves the need of having important, well-constructed tools and methods conducting the data acquisition process for managing properly: (a) the interaction over the mashup user interfaces, at the front-end side; (b) the storage of the interaction in relational databases; and (c) well-supported microservices structures handled in the cloud. The fact of having valuable and flexible data acquisition processes encourages the deployment of others important issues of the interaction management, i.e., data searching, data mining, marketing, security, accessibility, usability or traceability of interaction data, among others. In this article, we present a flexible Data Acquisition System capable of capturing the human-computer interactions performed by users over mashup (User) Interfaces with the aim of storing them in a relational database. Firstly, the morphology of traditional mashup applications, their specifications and the relevant information that surrounds an interaction have been studied. Thereupon, a data acquisition system that stores user interaction on mashup based on such specifications was constructed. To achieve that purpose, an architecture of microservices was also designed in the cloud to detect, acquire, and collect the interactions performed over this kind of interfaces. The whole process is ready for acquiring internal data of the information system as well as context information and location awareness. To validate the data acquisition system, some tests on empirical case studies have been developed. Efficiency and effectiveness have also been determined by evaluating the performance of the acquisition system during different load tests. Finally, in order to ensure the software quality, a continuous integration strategy for software development and an easy management of the code have been used, facilitating the software maintenance alongside the microservice architecture, where functionalities are well encapsulated.}

As far as product data are concerned, data exchange, 3D visualization, and communication are crucial processes for reusing manufacturing intelligence across lifecycle stages. Research and industry have developed several CAD interoperability, and visualization formats to uphold these product development strategies.

abstract = {This article presents a new methodology that enables designers to include in simulations not only the physics aspects of artifact behavior, but also human actions. The motivation for this research came from the fact that none of the conventional approaches to engineering simulations includes manipulative control of products by users as foreseen by designers. By implementing control over physics simulations, changes in parameters can be introduced that alter the course of the simulated process. As a means to do this, we propose to use scenario bundles, with which designers can operationalize their conjectures of how human users interact with products as a series of interconnected simulations. For the imaginary use process described in a scenario bundle, the designer can specify various product designs, user characteristics, and environments, which may in each case lead to different concatenations of simulation actions. The proposal facilitates the exploration of possible mismatches and anomalies in use processes. In this article, we describe the theoretical fundamentals and the overall concept of the proposed methodology, as well as its realization as a proof-of-concept implementation. This implementation can be used as a tool to specify scenario bundles and to perform controlled simulations of human–product interaction. The use of the tool is demonstrated through a practical example. Although the implementation has proven to be successful in terms of executing scenario bundles, two bottlenecks need further attention: (i) devising stable algorithms for large deformations in physical interaction simulation and (ii) incorporation of already existing algorithms for simulation of low-level human motion control.}

People with ABI demand solutions in research that offer them with a relearning process such that they can recover not only their physical skills but also their cognitive abilities. In this context, the inherent characteristics of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), transparency and intelligence, have turned it into one of the best approaches to square up to the impairment that ABI can cause. As AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly, these systems can react promptly to the needs of people with ABI while they carry out their rehabilitation process. Moreover, the exploitation of a Multi-Agent architecture emerges as a natural solution to develop AmI systems, since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. Therefore, in this paper, a Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) for healthcare AmI systems is presented. It contributes to treat people with ABI by using specific devices to control the patient's movements and some physiological responses, such as the variation of the heart rate, during her rehabilitation process. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is exploited. Finally, how this system is used to both design and execute therapies for people with ABI is presented.}

However, suitable cost and stable connectivity cannot be strongly guaranteed by existing architectures such as cellular networks, vehicular ad hoc networks, etc. With the prosperous development of artificial intelligence, cloud/edge computing and 5G network slicing, a more intelligent vehicular network is under deliberation. In this paper, an innovative paradigm called Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV) is proposed to help address the aforementioned challenge. Different from existing works, which mainly focus on communication technologies, CIoV enhances transportation safety and network security by mining effective information from both physical and network data space. We first present an overview of CIoV including its evolution, related technologies, and architecture. Then we highlight crucial cognitive design issues from three perspectives, namely, intra-vehicle network, inter-vehicle network and beyond-vehicle network. Simulations are then conducted to prove the effect of CIoV and finally some open issues will be further discussed. Our study explores this novel architecture of CIoV, as well as research opportunities in vehicular network.}

Therefore, the holding of this research is as a form of contribution to the development of Augmented Reality media as a learning medium. The form of contribution from this research is a simple Augmented Reality created by using qualitative method to collect and analyze the elementary students data and Marker Based Tracking method resulting an application that has a function as a hand-shaped prop teaching aid for learning the body parts of the hands in elementary school students. With this learning media, it is hoped that it would help teachers and elementary school students in studying the parts of human body. All elementary school teachers can use the Aplikasi AR Belajar Bagian Tangan as a teaching medium in elementary school laboratories on their elementary school students or as a prop while students listening to their teacher explanations while seeing which parts of the hand are pointed out by elementary school teachers through the Aplikasi AR Belajar Bagian Tangan. This Aplikasi AR Belajar Bagian Tangan may provide elementary school students with their study and experience in using AR as a learning medium that can improve students’ analytical skills.}

One of the challenges in software development regards the appropriate coupling of separated code elements in order to correctly build initially expected high-level software functionalities. In this context, we address issues related to the dynamic composition of such code elements (i.e. how they are dynamically plugged together) as well as their collaboration (i.e. how they work together). We also consider the limitation of build-level dependencies, to avoid the entire re-compilation and re-deployment of a software when modifying it or integrating new functionalities. To solve these issues, we propose a new design pattern coupling role and component concepts and illustrate its relevance for medical software. Compared to most related works focusing on few role concepts while ignoring others, the proposed pattern integrates many role concepts as first-class entities, including in particular a refinement of the notion of collaboration. Another significant contribution of our proposal concerns the coupling of role and component concepts. Roles are related to the functional aspects of a target software program (composition and collaboration of functional units). Components correspond to the physical distribution of code elements with limited build-level dependencies. As illustrated in this paper, such a coupling enables to instantiate a software program using a generic main program together with a description file focusing on software functionalities only. Related code elements are transparently retrieved and composed at run-time before appropriately collaborating, regardless the specificity of their distribution over components.}

abstract = {In the domain of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), recent advances in sensors, communication technologies, miniaturization and computing capabilities have led to new and advanced forms of interaction. Among them, Mixed Interactive Systems (MIS), form a class of interactive systems that comprises augmented reality, tangible interfaces and ambient computing; MIS aim to take advantage of physical and digital worlds to promote a more transparent integration of interactive systems with the user’s environment. Due to the constant change of technologies and the multiplicity of these interaction forms, specific development approaches have been developed. As a result, numerous taxonomies, frameworks, API and models have emerged, each one covering a specific and limited aspect of the development of MIS. To support a coherent use of these multiple development resources and contribute to the increasing popularity of MIS, we have developed a framework based on Model-Driven Engineering. The goal is to take advantage of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) standards, methodology and tools to support the manipulation of complementary Domain Specific Languages (DSL), to organize and link the use of different design and implementation resources, and to ensure a rationalized implementation based on design choices. In this paper, we first summarize existing uses of MDE in HCI before focusing on five major benefits MDE can provide in a MIS development context. We then detail which MDE tools and resources support these benefits and thus form the pillars of the success of an MDE-based MIS development approach. Based on this analysis, we introduce our framework, called Guide-Me, and illustrate its use through a case study. This framework includes two design models. Model transformations are also included to link one model to another; as a result the frameworks coverage extends from the earliest design step to a software component-based prototyping platform. A toolset based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) that supports the use of the framework is also presented. We finally assess our MDE-based development process for MIS based on the five major MDE benefits for MIS.}

abstract = {Nowadays, one-of-a-kind (OKP) companies, which generally operate in an 'engineer-to-order' business mode, strive to deliver individualized products with quality to achieve customer satisfaction. Thus, an accurate and prompt analysis of customer requirements (CRs) in the early design stage is critical to its success. However, most OKP companies are small or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Due to the limited resources and low product planning budget, they often cannot obtain abundant CR information nor can they afford the expense of complicated planning process. To address these issues, a system framework is proposed in support of OKP product planning process in a cloud-based design (CBD) environment. The challenges and future market niches of OKP companies are presented. The comparison of typical distributed systems shows that CBD, which utilizes advanced information technologies and business model, has advantages in providing sufficient resources, decreasing product development time span for OKP companies in a cost-efficient way. This article describes the proposed system architecture, the business interaction process and the information communication among customers, designers and marketing analysts at the product planning stage. To validate the proposed framework, a prototype system module MyProduct is under development in the CBD environment with an illustrative example.}

While organizations strive to focus on core competencies and becoming more flexible, an information platform which takes advantage of open, flexible Web 2.0 technologies is needed to increase the number of organizations involved in satisfying customer demand more effectively. In this paper, we describe a REST (Representational State Transfer)-based Web-Service and Web 2.0 technologies driven information platform for collaborative product development (WCPD). The WCPD aims to consolidate the once-fragmented world of customized product development into a more efficient platform of Collaboration 2.0, enabling products to be sourced and built more easily, quickly, inexpensively, and at higher quality levels.

The human associates these choices with end-functionality and is confident that the resulting grasp will be able to meet task requirements. We refer to these choices on the use of hand-parts underlying grasp formation as the grasp intention. Modeling the grasp intention offers a paradigm whereby decisions underlying grasp formation may be related to the functional properties of the realized grasp in terms of quantities which may be sensed/recognized or controlled. In this paper we model grasp intention as mix of oppositions between hand parts. Sub-parts of the hand acting in opposition to each other are viewed as a basis from which grasps are formed. We compute a set of such possible oppositions and determine the most likely combination from the raw information present in a demonstrated grasp. An intermediate representation of raw sensor data exposes interactions between elementary grasping surfaces. From this, the most likely combination of oppositions is inferred. Grasping experiments with humans show that the proposed approach is robust enough to correctly capture the intention in demonstrated grasps across a wide range of hand functionality.}

abstract = {Affective computing involves human–computer interaction (HCI) where an interface can detect and respond in context to a user’s emotions. Emotions play an essential role in the daily activities of a human during work and, as a consequence, can critically affect their decision-making. Recent research on affective computing opens the door to exploring the emotional aspects of computer aided tasks and HCI; however, there is little research in this area related to computer aided design (CAD). There is an established connection between emotional and cognitive processes and without these emotional markers decision-making in humans is almost non-existent. The holy grail of engineering design is for a concept to be ‘right-first-time’ and only by delving into the affect-cognitive domain will insights in terms of the associability of critical decision-making and the underlying intent of engineering decisions and tasks be better understood. Work in this field aims to recognize, interpret and process human emotions in order to support and adapt computer-based systems and their associated interfaces to user behaviors and to elicit appropriate system responses. This is a very contemporary area in engineering design research. One key aspect of provisioning CAD systems with the capability to detect the emotional state of the engineer is to lessen the chance of distorted reasoning as a result of irrational judgements. Work in this area can potentially identify emotional markers that influence the coherence/incoherence of reasoning against knowledge as well as the potential quality and suitability of a specific engineering solution or approach. This paper proposes and investigates a methodology to determine the emotional aspects attributed to a set of CAD design tasks by analyzing the CAD operators’ psycho-physiological signals. Two sets of experiments were conducted. A pilot case study focused on modeling tasks carried out in Solid Edge™ was run to prove the validity of the methodology, the tools applied and subsequent analysis. The main case study extended this to more wide-ranging user logging, incorporating a series of configuration and optimization tasks in Siemens NX™ for a real design task. Psycho-physiological signals of electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin resistance (GSR)/electrocardiography (ECG) were recorded along with a log of CAD system user interactions. A fuzzy logic model was established to map the psycho-physiological signals to a set of key emotions, namely frustration, satisfaction, engagement and challenge and the results analyzed. The methodology and subsequent analysis applied was found to be repeatable. Over the various task action-chains the elicitation and interpretation of each participant’s emotions were successfully carried out with significant correlations demonstrated between the associated engineers’ CAD activities and their reported emotional states.}

The 5G technology has been significantly revolutionized by the advent of the Internet of Things, and its quick and pervasive evolution. However, it remains imperative that all these devices work in a sequential manner to execute a collective and secure operation. Despite computing being focused around cloud infrastructures in the last two decades, the 5G networks and the huge amount of data it generates is presently inverting this trend, shifting computing power back to where data is generated from. To encompass different autonomous and collaborative systems with functions of data sensing and authentication between such systems in a predictive and adaptive manner is a challenging task. Wireless network design in 5G is expected to emphasize broadly on three facets: security, privacy and energy efficiency. Therefore, this paper investigates the role of various data security and privacy techniques for different generation networks, but emphasis is on 5G. It addresses encryption schemes with the focus on the challenges faced such as side channel and ciphertext attacks, inherent key generation, sharing and distribution, key escrow, analysis of various overheads, and potential techniques, and solutions to address such challenges by leveraging 5G network devices. With the proliferation of ubiquitous computing and wide adoption of hybrid encryption techniques, various attacks will be circumvent in an intelligent manner.}

During the conceptual design stage, the design information is limited and non-numerical, and thus, refinement cannot be performed via existing numerical algorithms. In addition, a conceptual scheme is formed by combining the appropriate principle solutions for different subfunctions, and different principle solutions can achieve different degrees of subsequent product performance satisfaction. Therefore, obtaining an improved principle solution with the maximum performance value is a critical issue that should be solved via conceptual scheme improvement. This paper proposes the concept of the performance value of the principle solution, and a scheme is improved based on the proposed concept. First, a performance feature model is constructed to analyze the different types of performance information required by the core subfunctions. Second, a correlation matrix composed of the performance and subfunctions is built. Third, a knowledge representation model is defined to analyze the performance knowledge associated with each principle solution; then, a correlation matrix of the principle solution and performance is built. Finally, performance is employed as the correlation factor, and the two matrices are multiplied to obtain a performance value matrix that represents the performance satisfaction degree of the principle solutions of each subfunction. A principle solution with a high performance value is selected to improve the current principle solution. Based on the above analysis process, a prototype conceptual design scheme improvement solution system (CDSIS system) is developed to assist in obtaining new principle solutions for a coal mining machine, and scheme improvement is preliminarily achieved.}

The VIP has evolved through previous EU research conducted within the VRShips-ROPAX 2000 (VRShips) project and the current version discussed here was developed predominantly within the VIRTUE project but also within the SAFEDOR project. The VIP is described with respect to the support it provides to designers and analysts in co-ordinating and optimising CFD analysis requests. Two case studies are provided that illustrate the application of the VIP within HSVA: the use of a panel code for the evaluation of geometry variations in order to improve propeller efficiency, and the use of a dedicated maritime RANS code (FreSCo) to improve the wake distribution for the VIRTUE tanker. A discussion is included detailing the background, application and results from the use of the VIP within these two case studies as well as how the platform was of benefit during the development and a consideration of how it can benefit HSVA in the future.}

Hierarchical, distributed and heterogeneous nature of computational instances make application placement in Fog a challenging task. Diversified user expectations and different features of IoT devices also intensify the application placement problem. Placement of applications to compatible Fog instances based on user expectations can enhance Quality of Experience (QoE) regarding the system services. In this paper, we propose a QoE-aware application placement policy that prioritizes different application placement requests according to user expectations and calculates the capabilities of Fog instances considering their current status. In Fog computing environment, it also facilitates placement of applications to suitable Fog instances so that user QoE is maximized in respect of utility access, resource consumption and service delivery. The proposed policy is evaluated by simulating a Fog environment using iFogSim. Experimental results indicate that the policy significantly improves data processing time, network congestion, resource affordability and service quality.}

However, successful collaborative product design depends on the ability to effectively manage and share engineering knowledge and data throughout the entire product development process. Co-design software platforms aim to facilitate cooperation in distributed teams. In the context of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) the advanced co-design software implementation to support the supply chain is not a trivial task. SMEs have peculiar characteristics such as flexibility, ICT skills and financial resources, which are difficult to be integrated within a structured design network. This paper presents a method to define and evaluate a co-design platform dedicated to SMEs in the mechanical product field. System architecture is defined by applying suitable metrics based on collaborative process characteristics in order to assess functionality performance of the available tools. Benchmarking is based on different levels of collaboration recognized in the typical product development process in SMEs. Correlation between process metrics, software functionalities and specific collaboration requirements is managed by adopting Quality Function Deployment (QFD) techniques. A practical case study allows the robustness of the proposed method to be verified and the main advantages and future developments to be discussed.}

abstract = {Context
The increased use of Open Source Software (OSS) affects how software-intensive product development organizations (SIPDO) innovate and compete, moving them towards Open Innovation (OI). Specifically, software engineering tools have the potential for OI, but require better understanding regarding what to develop internally and what to acquire from outside the organization, and how to cooperate with potential competitors.
Aim
This paper aims at synthesizing a theory of openness for software engineering tools in SIPDOs, that can be utilized by managers in defining more efficient strategies towards OSS communities.
Method
We synthesize empirical evidence from a systematic mapping study, a case study, and a survey, using a narrative method. The synthesis method entails four steps: (1) Developing a preliminary synthesis, (2) Exploring the relationship between studies, (3) Assessing the validity of the synthesis, and (4) Theory formation.
Result
We present a theory of openness for OSS tools in software engineering in relation to four constructs: (1) Strategy, (2) Triggers, (3) Outcomes, and (4) Level of openness.
Conclusion
The theory reasons that openness provides opportunities to reduce the development cost and development time. Furthermore, OI positively impacts on the process and product innovation, but it requires investment by organizations in OSS communities. By betting on openness, organizations may be able to significantly increase their competitiveness.}

The topological relationships are kept during the simplification by removing the Voronoi diagram’s self-overlapped regions. With the simplified vector maps, we establish different levels of detail (LOD) models of these maps. Then we introduce a client/server architecture which integrates our out-of-core algorithm, progressive transmission and rendering scheme based on computer graphics hardware. The architecture allows the viewers to view different regions interactively at different LODs on the network. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme provides an effective way for powerful transmission and manipulation of large maps.}

A feature model is the standard representation of features of all possible products as well as the relationships among them for an SPL. Recently, various multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been used to search for valid product configurations. However, the issue of the balance between correctness and diversity of solutions obtained in a reasonable time has been found very challenging for these algorithms. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel aggregation-based dominance (ADO) for Pareto-based evolutionary algorithms to direct the search for high-quality solutions. Our method was tested on two widely used Pareto-based evolutionary algorithms: NSGA-II and SPEA2+SDE and validated on nine different SPLs with up to 10,000 features and two real-world SPLs with up to 7 objectives. Our experiments have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of both ADO-based NSGA-II and SPEA2+SDE: (1) Both algorithms could generate 100% valid solutions for all feature models. (2) The performance of both algorithms was improved as measured by the hypervolume metric in 7/9 and 8/9 feature models. (3) Even for the largest tested feature model with 10,000 features, it required under 40 s on a standard desktop to find 100% valid solutions in a single run of both algorithms.}

Based on a critical review of Building Product Modelling, including the development of standards for exchange and the features of over 150 AEC/O (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation) tools and digital models, a methodological framework is proposed for improvements to both BIM tools and schemata. The features relevant to the framework were studied using a conceptual process model and a ‘BIM System-of-Systems’ (BIM-SoS) model. The development, implementation, and use of the BIM Schema are analysed from the standpoint of standardisation. The results embrace the requirements for a BIM research methodology, with an example of methods and procedures, an R&D review with critique, and a multi-standpoint framework for developments with concrete recommendations, supported by BIM metrics, upon which the progress of tools, models, and standards may be measured, evaluated, streamlined, and judged. It is also proposed that any BIM Schema will never be ‘completed’ but should be developed as evolutionary ontology by ‘segmented standpoint models’ to better account for evolving tools and AEC/O practices.}

abstract = {Continuous integration (CI) is a widely used practice in modern software engineering. Unfortunately, it is also an expensive practice. Google and Mozilla estimate their expenses for their CI systems in millions of dollars. To reduce the cost of CI, researchers developed multiple approaches to reduce its computational workload requirements. However, these approaches sometimes make mispredictions and skip failing builds which are not desirable to be skipped. Thus, in this paper, we aim to save computational cost in CI, while also maximizing the observation of failing builds, i.e., to skip builds more safely. First, we perform empirical studies to understand which builds are safe to skip, starting from CI-Skip rules (Abdalkareem et al., 2019) that characterize builds that developers decide to skip. We observe that CI-Skip rules are not so safe as expected. We then develop a collection of CI-Run rules that can complement these rules. Based on our findings, we propose PreciseBuildSkip, a novel approach that maximizes build failure observation and reduces the cost of CI through the strategy of build selection. We evaluate our approach and results show that our approach saved more cost (5.5%) than the safest existing technique but reduced the falsely skipped failing builds from 4.1% to 0% (median value).}

For the first time, engineering parameters are used as the intermediary between the complexity and technological evolution. Problematic engineering parameters are extracted from a current reality tree model through a natural language process. An artificial neural network is trained to predict the technological evolution law based on existing successful samples. Appropriate analogical objects are formed in an invention principle case library through the similarity analysis of engineering parameters.

Our approach enables the CAD/E platform to seamlessly adopt advances in the technology but leveraging work done through the broader open source community. Through these technologies and the access to the underlying source code rapidDCO is highly adaptable and can be applied to novel problems not readily supported by conventional CAD/CAE environments. Rather than building CAD/CAE capability from a “top down” tool perspective we take a model-centric approach, building capability from the model “up”. In rapidDCO individual models are defined as software components which are then shared as libraries that are used by the “component aware” environment. This component based approach means that development can be focused on defining specialised models to address a specific need and not on the infrastructure to realise and interact with those models. We present rapidDCO with a formal design customisation and optimisation example demonstrating the use of rapidDCO’s custom interface capability, distributed design and integration with the modeFrontier® design optimisation tool and Microsoft® Excel.}

Furthermore, the variety of such hidden axes across different cars/brands can be summarized in reduced dimensional spaces. Because features revealed by this technique are consistent with the framework of universal rules for aesthetic experiences (e.g., symmetry and perceptual problem solving), this could be useful to evaluate some aspects of aesthetic values quantitatively in car interiors.}

abstract = {Energy parity games are infinite two-player turn-based games played on weighted graphs. The objective of the game combines a (qualitative) parity condition with the (quantitative) requirement that the sum of the weights (i.e., the level of energy in the game) must remain positive. Beside their own interest in the design and synthesis of resource-constrained omega-regular specifications, energy parity games provide one of the simplest model of games with combined qualitative and quantitative objectives. Our main results are as follows: (a) exponential memory is sufficient and may be necessary for winning strategies in energy parity games; (b) the problem of deciding the winner in energy parity games can be solved in NP ∩ coNP; and (c) we give an algorithm to solve energy parity by reduction to energy games. We also show that the problem of deciding the winner in energy parity games is logspace-equivalent to the problem of deciding the winner in mean-payoff parity games, which can thus be solved in NP ∩ coNP. As a consequence we also obtain a conceptually simple algorithm to solve mean-payoff parity games.}

abstract = {This article presents an overview and analysis of the key cybersecurity problems, challenges and requirements to be addressed in the future, which we derived through 63 interviews with European stakeholders from security-critical sectors including Open Banking, Supply Chain, Privacy-preserving Identity Management, Security Incident Reporting, Maritime Transport, Medical Data Exchange, and Smart Cities. We show that common problems, challenges and requirements across these sectors exist in relation to building trust, implementing privacy and identity management including secure and useable authentication, building resilient systems, standardisation and certification, achieving security and privacy by design, secure and privacy-compliant data and information sharing, and government regulations. Our results also indicate cybersecurity trends and allow to derive directions for future research and innovation activities that will be of high importance for Europe.}

abstract = {An effective representation of additive manufacturing (AM) data is important for ensuring the repeatability of AM processes and the reproducibility of AM parts. Recently, several standardised representations have been developed and used in the industry. While at the same time, a number of other representations have been presented within the academia. The coexistence of different representations generates a series of questions and discussions: What is a representation of AM data? Are the standardised representations comprehensive enough to ensure the repeatability and reproducibility? What challenges have been addressed so far in the presented representations? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each representation? What are the main issues in the field of AM data representation currently? What are the potential research directions of AM data representation in the future? To approach these questions, a review of the existing representations of AM data is presented in this paper. Firstly, an in-depth analysis of the existing representations is provided. Then, detailed comparisons among these representations are made, and a discussion about the main issues in AM data representation is carried out on the basis of the comparisons. Finally, some future research directions of AM data representation are suggested.}

abstract = {Multimedia oriented Internet of Things (IoT) enables pervasive and real-time communication of video, audio and image data among devices in an immediate surroundings. Today's vehicles have the capability of supporting real time multimedia acquisition. Vehicles with high illuminating infrared cameras and customized sensors can communicate with other on-road devices using dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) and 5G enabled communication technologies. Real time incidence of both urban and highway vehicular traffic environment can be captured and transmitted using vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication modes. Video streaming in vehicular IoT (VSV-IoT) environments is in growing stage with several challenges that need to be addressed ranging from limited resources in IoT devices, intermittent connection in vehicular networks, heterogeneous devices, dynamism and scalability in video encoding, bandwidth underutilization in video delivery, and attaining application-precise quality of service in video streaming. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive review on video streaming in IoT environments focusing on vehicular communication perspective. Specifically, significance of video streaming in vehicular IoT environments is highlighted focusing on integration of vehicular communication with 5G enabled IoT technologies, and smart city oriented application areas for VSV-IoT. A taxonomy is presented for the classification of related literature on video streaming in vehicular network environments. Following the taxonomy, critical review of literature is performed focusing on major functional model, strengths and weaknesses. Metrics for video streaming in vehicular IoT environments are derived and comparatively analyzed in terms of their usage and evaluation capabilities. Open research challenges in VSV-IoT are identified as future directions of research in the area. The survey would benefit both IoT and vehicle industry practitioners and researchers, in terms of augmenting understanding of vehicular video streaming and its IoT related trends and issues.}

abstract = {An approach for managing the exchange of engineering product data between geographically distributed designers and analysts using a heterogeneous tool set for the through-life design of a ship is described. The approach was developed within a pan-European maritime project called VRShips-ROPAX 2000 that demonstrated how information technology could be integrated into the design process. This paper describes the development of a common model containing neutral ship product data through a bottom-up consideration of the requirements of the tools to be integrated, as well as a top-down consideration of the data requirements for through life design. This common model was supported within an Integrated Design Environment (IDE) that co-ordinated design activity distributed across Europe. The IDE ensured that the users were provided with the right data in the right form at the right time to do the right task, i.e., that the design activity was timely and appropriate. The strengths and weaknesses of the approach are highlighted.}
