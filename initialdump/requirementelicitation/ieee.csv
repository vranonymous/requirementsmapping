However, VR has not been widely used for eliciting human-centric requirements in software engineering contexts, which is an important gap in both the application of VR technology and the research of software engineering. To fill this gap, in this paper, we develop the VR4HcRE platform as a remote multiplayer collaboration and communication system to explore its benefits in human-centric requirement engineering. We consult with software developers and requirements engineers, as stakeholders of the system, to define the features of the system, including remote multiplayer collaboration, audio transcription, simulation of human and environmental factors, and UI design based on mobile phone prototype. We conduct a pilot experiment with 21 participants. Preliminary results indicate that using VR to capture user or special user needs has the potential value, including improving collaboration interaction and requirements expression, and bringing a different sense of participation compared with the physical world. As an ongoing work, we hope this paper generates a series of new research ideas in virtual reality and requirements elicitation.","2771-1110","978-1-6654-5365-3","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct57072.2022.00168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9974443","Virtual Reality;Human-centric Requirements Elicitation;Remote Multiplayer Collaboration;Human Factor;Software and Its Engineering-Software Creation and Management-Design Software-Requirements Analysis","Solid modeling;Communication systems;Collaboration;Prototypes;Software;Mobile handsets;Environmental factors","computer games;formal specification;groupware;mobile computing;software engineering;systems analysis;user interfaces;virtual reality","collaboration interaction;communication system;environmental factors;human factors;human-centric requirement engineering;interactive technology;remote multiplayer collaboration;requirements elicitation;requirements engineers;requirements expression;software developers;software engineering contexts;virtual reality platform;VR technology;VR4HcRE platform","","","","27","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Common models include use case diagrams, state charts, data flow diagrams, etc., all serving their own role in defining different perspectives of a system. These different perspectives of the same system can be a powerful technique to facilitate the analysis of requirements about the system. Using a virtual reality environment allows for the linking of multiple perspectives from the separate analysis models to be viewed in three dimensions. This approach can be particularly beneficial to students in learning how to analyze models by providing a mechanism to examine the visual relationship between the perspectives. Using this approach allows the student to view, create, manipulate, and alter models within the native three-dimensional space, which can provide an indepth experience better suited for learning. The virtual reality environment also allows models to be nested to provide better abstractions and layered to provide a level of complexity impossible to replicate in the traditional two-dimensional space. This paper explores a prototype virtual reality environment to facilitate the use of software requirement models for undergraduate software engineering students. As part of this work, students will be exposed to the tool and tasked with using the virtual reality environment to analyze the models of systems. Assessment of the use of the approach will be conducted and results will be presented including feedback from the students, benefits found, insights and potential ways to evolve the approach for other areas such as design or testing.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028676","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028676","Virtual Reality;Requirements Analysis;SoftwareEngineering Education","Solid modeling;Software;Analytical models;Virtual reality;Data models;Education","computer aided instruction;computer science education;data visualisation;software engineering;teaching;virtual reality","software requirements analysis;virtual reality environment;software requirement models;teaching;native three-dimensional space","","","","10","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One aspect is the social isolation. Many VR experiences do not represent yourself or other users, making it lonely rather than a shared experience. VR applications that do offer a user representation mostly use artificial avatars. These applications may not be well suited for all communication use cases (e.g. at work or with your family). In this paper I present our current work, at TNO and in my PhD research, to create Social VR experiences where both the user and the environment are represented in photo-realistic quality. The aim is not only to allow users to experience VR together, but also to allow new ways of natural communication within VR, with an extended presence and immersion. My PhD research focuses on 3 aspects that are building a Social VR system: capture and processing, transmission and client composition. The main goal of my research is to move processing from the capture and orchestration into the cloud (and particularly into the edge network) to allow Social VR with a large set of users (100+) in one session and to support mobile end devices while maximizing the QoS and QoE.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-1377-7","10.1109/VR.2019.8797877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8797877","Virtual Reality;VR;Social VR;Requirements;WebRTC;WebVR;Immersive Virtual Environments;Information systems;World Wide Web;Web conferencing;Multimedia information systems;Multimedia streaming","Virtual reality;Three-dimensional displays;Cameras;Quality of service;Quality of experience;Streaming media;Real-time systems","cloud computing;social networking (online);virtual reality","consumer market;social isolation;shared experience;VR applications;photo-realistic quality;natural communication;social VR experiences;social VR system;multiuser virtual reality commnunication","","1","","10","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This, in turn, provides an environment for the validation of system models. The visual model strengthens the specifier's ability to grasp the system's complexity, build a correct mental model of the system and write the symbolic specification. The visual model can also serve as a bridge between the domain expert and symbolic specification, and provide evidence of the correctness of the formalization process.

Eliminating the elements of the system that can cause a negative learning and training transfer is a paramount in those systems.

It has been realized in form of various annotation systems that have been discussed in many publications. Unfortunately, the focus usually lies on high-level functionality, like interaction metaphors and display strategies. We argue that it is worthwhile to also consider software engineering aspects. Annotation systems often share similar functionality that can potentially be factored into reusable components with the goal to speed up the creation of new annotation systems. At the same time, however, VR-centered annotation systems are not only subject to application-specific requirements, but also to those arising from differences between the various VR platforms, like desktop VR setups or CAVEs. As a result, it is usually necessary to build application-specific VR-centered annotation systems from scratch instead of reusing existing components. To improve this situation, we present a framework that provides reusable and adaptable building blocks to facilitate the creation of flexible annotation systems for VR applications. We discuss aspects ranging from data representation over persistence to the integration of new data types and interaction metaphors, especially in context of multi-platform applications. To underpin the benefits of such an approach and promote the proposed concepts, we describe how the framework was applied to several of our own projects.","2328-7829","978-1-4673-6881-0","10.1109/SEARIS.2015.7854096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7854096","D.2.11 [Software Engineering]: Software;Architectures-Domain-specific architectures I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism-Virtual reality","Metadata;Context;Software engineering;Organizations;Computer architecture;Virtual reality","data analysis;data integration;data structures;virtual reality","flexible virtual-reality-centered annotation systems;note-taking;data analysis;VR-centered annotation systems;reusable adaptable building blocks;VR applications;data representation;data type integration;interaction metaphors;multiplatform applications","","3","","17","IEEE","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then based on these requirements collected from secondary vocational teachers, we propose a design model with recommendations for educational VR fast prototyping. This model comprises four modules: learning resources, shared resources database, built-in templates, and scanning modeling. Additionally, it suggests the prototyping should have functions including no programming, low fidelity, interactive and immersive, offline download, team collaboration, and multi-platform operation.","","978-1-6654-8188-5","10.1109/CSTE55932.2022.00009","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62077036); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0100501); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973115","virtual reality;prototyping;vocational education;interviews;questionnaires","Solid modeling;Analytical models;Databases;Computational modeling;Education;Collaboration;Virtual reality","computer aided instruction;teaching;virtual reality;vocational training","built-in templates;design model;educational VR prototyping;learning resources;multiplatform operation;offline download;requirements analysis;scanning modeling;secondary vocational teachers;shared resources database;teaching;team collaboration;virtual reality;vocational education;VR prototyping tools","","","","8","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional attention enhancement approaches have high requirements on the external environment, and thus have such limitations as long intervention periods, high costs, poor universality, and insignificant therapeutic effects. Virtual Reality (VR) can provide interactive and immersive environments, which can help to break through these limitations and effectively enhance users' attention. In this paper, we propose a novel neurofeedback attentional enhancement approach based on VR. The proposed approach utilizes the $\alpha$ band power in the parieto-occipital regions of the brain as an neurofeedback index of the users' attention, and prompts users by changing the attributes of the VR environment. Statistical results show that the $\alpha$ band power reduces significantly in neurofeedback group compared with that in control group. Accordingly, task performances in neruofeedback group are improved by 6.44% compared with those of control group.

Students continue to face several difficulties when learning programming [1] and the lack of efficient tools to overcome such difficulties can affect the students' motivation [2]. Over time, this creates a drastic and negative impact in their attitude towards `learning programming,' which is undesirable for student success in engineering education. To rectify this, a suitable approach that can motivate students needs to be developed to change students' mindset towards learning programming. Student motivation is considered imperative as it is directly influences a student's perseverance and dedication towards accomplishing an objective [3]. Rather than viewing programming courses as a means to complete coursework requirements, students should be made to realize the `power of programming.' Learning and gaining experience in computer programming necessarily involves the development of computational/critical thinking and problem solving skills. All these skills sharpen the minds of the students while simultaneously opening up multiple job prospects for them upon graduation. To this end, to facilitate interactive and fun-filled learning, this research employs a learner-centric, user-friendly Virtual Environment (VE) to teach programming concepts. In doing so, this research aims to make a paradigm shift in the `approach to teaching and learning programming.'","2154-0373","978-1-4799-4774-4","10.1109/EIT.2014.6871829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6871829","programming instruction;desktop virtual reality;interactive visualization;engineering education","Programming profession;Education;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Visualization;Problem-solving","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;engineering education;teaching;virtual reality","fun-learning approach;adaptive virtual reality platform;VR;engineering students;fun-based interactive programming instruction;engineering education courses;programming courses;computer programming;computational-critical thinking;problem solving skills;job prospects;graduation;learner-centric user-friendly virtual environment;VE;programming concepts","","17","","25","IEEE","7 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language), which is a Web-based standard, is explored as a means of remotely interrogating information stored within an integrated database. VRML allows the creation of 3D views and worlds which can be explored in real time. This paper describes the steps taken to link the OSCON integrated database to a VRML environment. It addresses the issue of using VR as the medium for the remote accessing of information within an integrated environment. For instance, site engineers can query the database from their sites if they have access to a modem and the Internet. Technologies are now available which can be used to this end. The Internet and its facilities should be exploited for the benefits of better management and retrieval of construction information. VR has often been looked on as a visualisation tool. This paper puts the argument that VR should be used as a user interface. For instance, the user should interact with a 3D column in VR rather than a column in a traditional database environment. This allows the construction practitioners better access to information which will motivate them to use integrated databases. In addition, VR should be used as a vehicle for classifying information. The user should be able to look at the design, costing, time planning and facilities management views according to his/her requirements. This may prove helpful in projecting information from a project integrated database.","1093-9547","0-8186-8076-8","10.1109/IV.1997.626513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=626513","","Virtual reality;Internet;Web sites;Data engineering;Modems;Information retrieval;Visualization;User interfaces;Visual databases;Vehicles","project engineering;building;civil engineering computing;virtual reality;graphical user interfaces;query processing;engineering information systems;Internet;simulation languages;data visualisation;object-oriented databases;engineering graphics","virtual reality interface;integrated project database environment;World Wide Web;VRML;Virtual Reality Modelling Language;remote interrogation;real-time exploration;OSCON integrated database;remote access;site engineers;database querying;Internet;construction information management;data visualisation;user interface;information classification;design;costing;time planning;facilities management;construction information retrieval","","3","2","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The author is working on two research projects in Boeing Computer Services that have to do with virtual reality technology. The first involves importing aircraft CAD data into a VR environment. Applications include a side range of engineering and design activities, all of which involve being able to view and interact with the CAD geometry as if one were inside an actual physical mockup of the aircraft. He refers to the technology being explored in the second project as ""Augmented Reality"". This entails the use of a see-through head-mounted display with an optical focal length of about 20 inches, along with VR-style position/orientation sensing system. The intended application area is in touch labor manufacturing: superimposing diagrams or text onto the surface of a workpiece and stabilizing it there on specific coordinates, so that the appropriate information needed by a factory worker for each step of a manufacturing or assembly operation appears on the surface of the workpiece as if it were painted there. The hardest technical problem for augmented reality is position tracking. Long-range head position/orientation sensing systems that can operate in factory environments are needed. This requirement and others give rise to some interesting computational problems, including wearer registration and position sensing using image processing.<>","1095-791X","0-7803-9992-7","10.1109/WESCON.1994.403622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=403622","","Virtual reality;Augmented reality;Aircraft propulsion;Design automation;Manufacturing;Production facilities;Application software;Aerospace engineering;Design engineering;Geometrical optics","virtual reality;aerospace computing;engineering graphics;manufacture;aircraft;CAD","virtual reality technology;aircraft design;aircraft manufacturing;research projects;Boeing Computer Services;aircraft CAD data;CAD geometry;augmented reality;head-mounted display;position/orientation sensing system;touch labor manufacturing;position tracking;factory environments","","15","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users can interactively evaluate design concepts, manufacturing workcells, processes and factory layouts at geographically remote locations to support informal and formal IPPD meetings. Anyone on the network can assume control of the simulation and make changes in real-time that can be visualized by others on the network. Benefits include: facilitating and streamlining design reviews; linking integrated product teams early in acquisition programs; integrating suppliers and users to get early feedback in design; and reducing travel costs and improving communications across integrated product teams throughout a program's life cycle. VCE capability enables interactive graphic simulation and development of key elements, including: system performance requirements; configuration definition; assembly sequences and tooling concepts; shop floor layout; handling requirements; and training.

As a result of our six years' experience in building first and second-generation VR devices to support these applications, we consider third-generation VR devices that will provide desktop/office-sized displays. Since no current technology is yet configurable with ideal resolution and size, we first simulate these devices with available parts, and then build more advanced prototypes. We believe that the devices we propose to build using the new display technologies form a set of desirable human/computer interface requirements for successful tele-immersion adoption.

Orientation in space and balance maintenance requires inputs from the vestibular, the visual, the proprioceptive and the somatosensory systems. All the cues coming from these systems are integrated by the central nervous system (CNS) to employ different strategies for orientation and balance. How the CNS integrates all the inputs and makes cognitive decisions about balance strategies has been an area of interest for biomedical engineers for a long time. More interesting is the fact that in the absence of one or more cues, or when the input from one of the sensors is skewed, the CNS ""adapts"" to the new environment and gives less weight to the conflicting inputs [1]. The focus of this paper is a review of different strategies and models put forward by researchers to explain the integration of these sensory cues. Also, the paper compares the different approaches used by young and old adults in maintaining balance. Since with age the musculoskeletal, visual and vestibular system deteriorates, the older subjects have to compensate for these impaired sensory cues for postural stability.

Hence, advanced video compression algorithms with high efficiency for delivery of a video in the format of VR are vital. In this paper, we present an objective-based performance study of different implementations of the AOMedia Video 1 (AV1) video codec for 360-degree videos with a resolution of UHD. Different quality presets that set the balance between the visual quality and encoding speed for the same bitrate are also considered. The Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) objective metric, developed by Netflix, is used to measure the quality of the video sequences.

The next generation mobile networks 5G can match network and computing resources according to service requirements, which will be the communication technology for the VR industry. In 5G architecture, the introduction of Software Defined Networking (SDN) decouples the control plane and the forwarding plane, and provides the ability of more granular network resource management. It can actively allocate resources for VR video to optimize transmission performance. In this paper, a QoE-driven Fine-grained routing (QFR) scheme based on SDN has been proposed. The core of QFR is the route calculation algorithm and the route allocation strategy. The route calculation algorithm is a two-stage adaptive routing algorithm. In the first stage, by means of an improved Dijkstra algorithm, the algorithm calculates k paths with the shortest delay. In the second stage, the k paths with the shortest delay are ranked according to the predicted QoE of each path. In addition, tile-based VR video provides a prerequisite for fine-grained routing scheduling. Through differentiated routing of Field of View (FoV) video streaming and Non-FoV video streaming, we develope a fine-grained route allocation strategy. The route allocation strategy determines how to allocate the sorted k paths with the shortest delay according to the residual bandwidth. Comparative evaluation of QFR is conducted to show its preponderance over several existing routing schemes, in terms of download bitrate and QoE of VR video.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-3106-1","10.1109/WCNC45663.2020.9120628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9120628","VR video streaming;5G;SDN;QoE;routing","5G mobile communication;Bit rate;Bandwidth;Virtual reality;Streaming media;Routing;Prediction algorithms","optimisation;quality of experience;quality of service;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication scheduling;video streaming;virtual reality","route calculation algorithm;QoE-driven Fine-grained routing;granular network resource management;forwarding plane;control plane;Software Defined Networking;VR industry;service requirements;computing resources;next generation mobile networks;adaptive routing scheme;Virtual Reality video users;quality of experience requirements;SDN;Virtual Reality video streaming;QFR;fine-grained route allocation strategy;fine-grained routing scheduling;tile-based VR video;predicted QoE;shortest delay;improved Dijkstra algorithm;two-stage adaptive routing algorithm","","4","","16","IEEE","19 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among them, immersive virtual reality is more favored by people because of its good sense of bringing in experience. In terms of metal wire rendering method research, it is combined with virtual reality technology to continuously meet people's requirements. This paper proposes a 3D cloud modeling method with strong artistic controllability. Artists use modeling tools to generate 3D cloud external contours. The contours are preprocessed by spatial subdivision to obtain the 3D cloud spatial distribution represented by a 3D grid. In terms of 3D cloud rendering, the 3D cloud model represented by the grid is converted into a particle space representation, and the improved forward multi-directional scattering illumination method is used to calculate the illumination and coloring of the cloud, which realizes the dynamic real-time illumination of the 3D cloud based on particles. The controllability of the three-dimensional cloud shape and the dynamic lighting based on physics effectively solve the problem of combining wire rendering and virtual reality technology.","","978-1-7281-8573-6","10.1109/ICCEIC51584.2020.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9361792","Virtual reality;wire;rendering;image","Cloud computing;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Wires;Lighting;Virtual reality;Rendering (computer graphics)","cloud computing;lighting;materials science computing;metals;rendering (computer graphics);solid modelling;virtual reality;wires","computer technology;Internet;immersive virtual reality;three-dimensional cloud shape;metal wire;3D cloud modeling;artistic controllability;modeling tools;3D cloud external contours;spatial subdivision;3D cloud spatial distribution;3D grid;3D cloud rendering;particle space representation;forward multidirectional scattering illumination;coloring;dynamic real-time illumination;dynamic lighting;physics","","","","12","IEEE","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the VR developing fields nowadays is education. VR in education is used as virtual experiments, in electrical particularly. An electrical experiment in education also needs evaluation to know the students' development and understanding. One of the ways to do that is by doing assessments. There are two types of assessments, formative and summative. One of the formative assessments is in form of pre-test and post-test. In this paper, we focused on the formative assessment process of an electrical experiment from Vocational High School in Indonesia. In order to get the initial score, students take a pre-test right before working on the experimental manipulation, based on the current materials. They then take a post-test after finishing the experiment to get the final score, which will be displayed on an e-learning website. As part of the designing process, we also conducted an online survey to some Indonesian Vocational High School teachers to investigate user requirements and developed a VR mockup in an electrical experiment simulation to do pre-test and post-tests. Based on the preliminary experiment that we conducted, it is shown that two important indicators in assessment, validity and reliability, could be done in the VR environment and help Indonesian Vocational High School teachers in evaluating their students' understanding and development.","","978-1-7281-4928-8","10.1109/ICIDM51048.2020.9339656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9339656","virtual reality;education;electrical experiment;assessment","Solid modeling;Electronic learning;Education;Virtual reality;Reliability theory;Reliability engineering;Testing","computer aided instruction;student experiments;virtual reality;vocational training","VR mockup;electrical experiment simulation;VR environment;VR electrical experiment;virtual reality;computer technology;simulated environment;immersive experiences;virtual experiments;formative summative;formative assessments;formative assessment process;Indonesian vocational high school teacher","","","","18","IEEE","4 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The next-gen cellular network name 5G networks have to provide efficient service, coverage, and data rate to such resource-hungry applications. Thereby, the deployment of small cell base stations (SBS) is a prominent solution to assist such applications. Since in the case of small cell transmitter-receiver separation distance is small compared to the macro cell and therefore degradation or attenuation of a wireless signal is comparatively low. This is necessary to ensure a high data rate. Therefore the research intended to allocate optimal or efficient power and bandwidth in SBS to obtain the required coverage in terms of SINR (Signal to Noise and Interference Ration) and network throughput to support AR/VR applications. The work presented an algorithm for efficient resource allocation and performed a few measurements to considering the algorithm. The research derived that the presented algorithm is able to allocate power and bandwidth as per network requirements.","","978-1-6654-2870-5","10.1109/ICIT52682.2021.9491124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9491124","AR;VR;5G;Small Cell;Coverage;Bandwidth","Cellular networks;Wireless communication;Software algorithms;Bandwidth;Interference;Virtual reality;Throughput","5G mobile communication;augmented reality;cellular radio;next generation networks;optimisation;radio transceivers;radiofrequency interference;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;virtual reality","resource allocation;SINR;signal to noise and interference ration;virtual reality;5G networks;next-gen cellular network;small cell base stations;resource-hungry applications;augmented reality;bandwidth-aware transmission planning;optimal coverage;wireless signal;macro cell;cell transmitter-receiver separation distance","","1","","12","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is particularly useful for educational fields that require students to visit certain locations, or that concern hazardous situations and materials. The EIT Raw Materials Project MiReBooks intends to develop novel augmented and virtual reality teaching tools to mining education. Within the project, we developed an interactive multi-user VR environment, named MiReBooks VR, for teaching mining to students by simulating a VR mine and creating learning scenarios in it. In this paper, we briefly described MiReBooks VR, and then focused on determining the capacity of the server running in a head-mounted display by measuring latency. To assess the system's capacity to handle multiple students connected to a class session, client simulation tests of up to 30 simultaneous connections were conducted. The results suggests performance issues with respect to latency affecting all peers that could cause a negative effect to the VR user experience. In addition, the results indicate that the frame rate requirements for VR applications are difficult to maintain in multi-user environments using current off-the-shelf VR equipment. Based on the development experiences and the tests, we provide five lessons learned that can be of interest to software engineers and researchers working on the development of multi-user VR systems.","","978-1-6654-2318-2","10.1109/IMCOM51814.2021.9377356","European Institute of Innovation and Technology(grant numbers:18060); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377356","Virtual Reality;VR;Education;Mining;Multi-User;Immersion;Head Mount Display;Performance;Network","Solid modeling;Education;Virtual reality;Tools;User experience;Software;Servers","computer aided instruction;mining;teaching;virtual reality","hazardous situations;mining education;multiuser VR environment;VR mine;head-mounted display;client simulation tests;VR user experience;frame rate requirements;multiuser environments;off-the-shelf VR equipment;development experiences;multiuser VR systems;network performance;multiuser virtual reality environment;realistic environments;immersive educational tool;educational fields;EIT Raw Materials Project;MiReBooks VR","","5","","19","IEEE","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This algorithm calculates how many blood particles are needed to model a particular instance of bleeding, and assigns a velocity to each particle in a gravitational field so that particles flow out of the injured region at the proper rate. The key characteristics of our algorithm are a visually realistic display and real-time computational performance. Experiment results show that proposed method is feasible and effective.

Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) persons have special needs for information presentation because they feel and perceive VR environments differently. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to requirements about presenting information in VR for this group of users. Previous research showed that adding special features and using haptic methods helps DHH persons to do VR tasks better. In this paper, we propose a novel Omni-directional particle visualization method and also evaluate multi-modal presentation methods in VR for DHH persons, such as audio, visual, haptic, and a combination of them (AVH). Additionally, we compare the results with the results of persons without hearing problems. The methods for information presentation in our study focus on spatial object localization in VR. Our user studies show that both DHH persons and persons without hearing problems were able to do VR tasks significantly faster using AVH. Also, we found out that DHH persons can do visual-related VR tasks faster than persons without hearing problems by using our new proposed visualization method. Our results suggest that the benefits of using audio among persons without hearing problems and the benefits of using vision among DHH persons cause an interesting balance in the results of AVH between both groups. Finally, our qualitative and quantitative evaluation indicates that both groups of participants preferred and enjoyed AVH modality more than other modalities.","2642-5254","978-1-6654-1838-6","10.1109/VR50410.2021.00084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417786","Virtual Reality-Information Presentation-Visualization Techniques-Spatial Object Localization-Deaf and Hard-of- Hearing","Location awareness;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Cognitive processes;Auditory system;Virtual reality;User interfaces","cognition;data visualisation;handicapped aids;haptic interfaces;hearing;user interfaces;virtual reality","DHH persons;hearing problems;visual-related VR tasks;multimodal spatial object localization;Virtual Reality;information visualization techniques;information presentation;VR environments;adding special features;using haptic methods;novel Omni-directional particle visualization method;multimodal presentation methods","","3","","39","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper discusses approaches for supporting copresent head-tracked users in an immersive projection environment, such as the CAVEtrade, without relying on additional projection and frame-multiplexing technology. The primary technique presented here is called image blending and consists of rendering independent views for each head-tracked user to an off-screen buffer and blending the images into a final composite view using view-vector incidence angles as weighting factors. Additionally, users whose view-vectors intersect a projection screen at similar locations are grouped into a view-cluster. Clustered user views are rendered from the average head position and orientation of all users in that cluster. The clustering approach minimizes users' exposure to undesirable display artifacts such as inverted stereo pairs and nonlinear object projections by distributing projection error over all tracked viewers. These techniques have the added advantage that they can be easily integrated into existing systems with minimally increased hardware and software requirements. We compare image blending and view clustering with previously published techniques and discuss possible implementation optimizations and their tradeoffs.","2375-5334","978-1-4244-3943-0","10.1109/VR.2009.4810998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4810998","Immersive Virtual Reality;Multi-Viewer Images;Collaboration;Geometry Shader;I.3.3 Picture/Image Generation - Display Algorithms;Viewing Algorithms;I.3.7 Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism - Virtual Reality","Rendering (computer graphics);Collaboration;Collaborative work;Hardware;Virtual reality;Clustering algorithms;Head;Polarization;Layout;Geology","groupware;image processing;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","image blending;view clustering;multiviewer immersive projection environments;multiwall immersive virtual environments;collaborative work;stereographic rendering;CAVE;frame-multiplexing technology","","6","3","16","IEEE","7 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although there are some works in the literature that explore the application of software testing practices specific to the context of Virtual Reality (VR), these works tend to reflect only the researcher's point of view, leaving aside the players involved in the VR development process, contributing to a gap that makes it difficult to popularize such practices. Aiming to reduce this gap, this paper presents an analysis under the perception of stakeholders involved in the process of developing and using VR applications. We conducted a survey with 88 respondents, comprising different roles, interviewed during a virtual reality scientific conference and later complemented by electronic dissemination, reaching five different profiles. The results showed that there is a major concern among all the interviewed profiles regarding the impact of faults in VR applications. In addition, we investigated these results in both software and hardware aspects. The results related to software pointed to a greater concern of the players regarding visual aspects and non-functional requirements.

The goal of this study is to investigate the affective state in VR head-mounted display (HMD) when the user watches videos displayed in different formats, i.e., 2D video, panoramic video and 360 video. In order to conduct this study, we designed an experiment procedure as well as an emotion annotation and monitoring system, which can not only obtain affective states of users but also collect physiological signals and behavior movements when the user watches videos in different formats. Furthermore, we used post-questionnaire to investigate the sense of presence, emotional induction and dominance of users. Some findings in the current study are summarized in the experimental results to give an insight for VR application developers so that they can use videos in suitable formats to evoke emotions in accordance with their requirements.","","978-1-6654-3225-2","10.1109/AIVR52153.2021.00055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9644328","affective state;emotion annotation;circumplex model;physiological signals;virtual reality","Solid modeling;Head-mounted displays;Conferences;Two dimensional displays;Virtual environments;Resists;Media","emotion recognition;helmet mounted displays;video signal processing;virtual reality","physiological signals;behavior movements;emotional induction;VR application developers;affective state;VR HMD user;virtual reality;sensory experience;controllable virtual environment;perceptual immersion;LCD screen;VR head-mounted display;panoramic video;emotion annotation","","1","","18","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We put forward the idea that to achieve a truly multimodal, mobile and personal VR system, one has to rely on the use of microsystem technology for most of the interfacing devices. An example is the display unit which has evolved from the monitor or VDU to a lightweight head mounted display and which is now being mounted onto a spectacle frame. Further developments suggest the design of semi-transparent contact lenses that would display computer images. A microsystem is the integration of miniaturised sensors, actuators and signal processing units and involves the functional integration of mechanical, electronic, optical and other functional elements at the sub-millimetre scale. Microsystems technology for interfacing devices must be: expandable and upgradable; cheap, replaceable and disposable; low power consumption, strong recovery capability after power or control failure; and robust and capable of sustaining the different stresses caused by the user.","","","10.1049/ic:19980749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=744427","","","virtual reality","virtual reality;enabling technology;microsystems;communication link;wearable computers;microsystem technology;interfacing devices;lightweight head mounted display;spectacle frame;contact lenses;computer images;miniaturised sensors;actuators;signal processing units","","1","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, there are still some problems. Along with the improvement of hydrological telemetering systems, more and more data could be acquired. The inconsistencies in data, as well as bulk information processing would intensify the pressure of clients noticeably. Besides, water resources information systems are usually not intuitionistic enough, and it is difficult for users to recognize underlying surface features comprehensively. This paper explored the integration of data warehouse (DW), virtual reality (VR) and GIS in water resources information system to solve the problems mentioned above, while Yinzhou District, located in Ningbo, Eastern China, was selected as the research area to develop the system. Firstly, DW was built in this system to integrate hydrological data from ultra-short wave (USW) telemetering system with those from general packet radio service (GPRS) telemetering system, providing the system with desirable data without massive calculation in clients. Secondly, remote sensing image was utilized as the base map of the system, which was also used for three-dimensional animations generation so that watershed characteristics could be demonstrated more intuitively. Finally, with the help of GIS, water resources information system was developed which could meet diverse practical requirements of water conservancy management.","","978-1-4244-8351-8","10.1109/ICSDM.2011.5969095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5969095","Water resources information system;data warehouse;virtual reality;geographical information system;integration","Water resources;Geographic Information Systems;Water conservation;Databases;Animation;Data warehouses","computer animation;data warehouses;environmental management;geographic information systems;geophysics computing;hydrology;remote sensing;telemetry;virtual reality;water resources","data warehouse;virtual reality;geographical information system;water resources management;GIS;water resources information system;water conservancy management;hydrological telemetering system;Yinzhou District;hydrological data;ultra-short wave telemetering system;USW telemetering system;general packet radio service;GPRS telemetering system;remote sensing image;three-dimensional animation","","2","","18","IEEE","1 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One requirement of such a system is that the presented figure must be viewable from various directions, similarly to a real human. In this paper such a view is called ""multiview"". By presenting a real-time human figure with ""multiview"", many participants can interact with the figure from all directions, similarly to interaction in the real world.

Current research efforts are focused in the following areas: (1) efficient implementation of fully adaptive multi-resolution methods, and (2) multi-resolution methods with specialized basis functions to capture the singularity at the haptic interface (point loading). To achieve real-time computations, we propose parallel processing of a Jacobi pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method applied to a reduced system of equations resulting from surface domain decomposition. This can effectively be achieved using reconfigurable computing systems such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), thereby providing a flexible solution that allows for new FPGA implementations as improved algorithms become available.

The power of conveying ideas and experiences through realistic 3D presentations is well established, and interactivity with objects and other digital participants is the basis for success in achieving common goals and increasing outcomes such as scores. This experience builds on analogues from military war rooms and childhood role playing with plastic toys and board games. Building a more comprehensive world with deeper ""real-i ness"" such as physics, voice chat, and ownership has provided a platform for much richer presence and communal development of ideas and services. Virtual Worlds (VWs) have proven their value in marketing, meetings, and education, with steady adoption and penetration into business sectors. A natural extension of this power is in Requirements Definition. Beyond presenting a proposal for experimentation in this vein, this paper proposes that these three-dimensional immersive environments will inevitably become an intrinsic and expected part of processes where product and service requirements are derived and evaluated.","2155-7667","978-1-4577-0935-7","10.1109/MERE.2011.6043944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6043944","Virtual world;second life;video-based requirements;storytelling;scenarios","Three dimensional displays;Media;Avatars;Business;Second Life;Availability;Conferences","computer games;systems analysis;virtual reality","virtual world tools;requirements engineering;virtual environments;home game players;movie goers;realistic 3D presentations;military war rooms;childhood role playing;plastic toys;board games","","","","3","IEEE","13 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this mean, systems combining Brain Computer Interface based on motor imagery (MI-BCI) with virtual reality (VR) have been developed. These systems translate the user's motor intention detected in the electroencephalography recording into a control signal, which activates a feedback module. This module should provide patients with visual feedback in realtime immersive environments, in order to motivate them during therapy and make them feel part of the virtual environment. This article describes the design and development of a VR interface, which could be used as visual feedback in a MI-BCI system during the upper and lower limbs rehabilitation of stroke patients. In order to design the VR feedback interface, characteristics that would promote the patients neuronal plasticity were considered: (a) a motivating and attractive VR interface presenting an avatar that resembles to the patient; (b) the possibility of executing functional tasks related to the skills that need to be rehabilitated; (c) real time communication between the user and the virtual environment. In addition, technical design requirements were considered: (a) real time communication between the MI-BCI system and the VR interface; (b) a VR interface that could be used in a computer device with limited resources. As a result, the VR interface, which was developed using Unity3D and satisfied the design requirements, is presented.","","978-1-5386-5032-5","10.1109/ARGENCON.2018.8646096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8646096","virtual reality;Unity3D;brain computer interface;neurorehabilitation","Avatars;Visualization;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces;Medical treatment;Stroke (medical condition)","avatars;brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;human computer interaction;medical robotics;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","virtual reality Interface built;Unity3D;BCI systems;motor imagery;rehabilitation therapy;stroke patients;motor skills;mean systems;Brain Computer Interface;motor intention;feedback module;visual feedback;realtime immersive environments;virtual environment;VR interface;MI-BCI system;upper limbs rehabilitation;lower limbs rehabilitation;VR feedback interface;patients neuronal plasticity","","","","23","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The topic for discussion surrounding this area is the need for a user friendly package that utilizes game and advanced Virtual Reality (VR) Technology to encompass the principles of the Lean approach to manufacturing. Fundamental principles adopted by video game developers attempting to immerse the user could provide a key, through allowing for a fully immersive manufacturing simulation software package. The implementation of VR and training software that would not only teach, but also showcase new technology and show its relevance in a manufacturing system. As a result the use of Lean philosophy acts as a conduit in the implementation of the VR software in adaptable modern manufacturing. Literature within Lean Manufacturing and Video Game Development Immersion Methodologies allow for a juxtaposition between the two, through promoting the validity of novel simulation training techniques. Evaluating case studies of Lean Manufacturing applications will ascertain the need for innovative adaptations, by determining whether solutions could be further improved by latest technological advancements. This paper critically appraises gaming technology and its evolution towards sophisticated design solutions. Learning theories adopted through gaming reveal new approaches to motivational drivers in developing necessary skill sets for modern workforces. Studies surrounding objective based instructional learning highlight rarely acknowledged fields in manufacturing simulation testing. Project Sponsor: Nottingham Trent University & PepsiCo The simulation software is to be built using Unity3D with scripting in C# and Java Script which emulates running of a manufacturing cell within a Lean environment. Its purpose is to train and educate personnel through simulating a functioning manufacturing cell. The software displays potential Lean wastes and problems such as bottle necking. It is imperative to the development of modern manufacturing environments that new simulation techniques in educating workforces, creating prototypes and testing are embraced. Currently only the latter two developments are predominantly created in unison. In Lean, this is wasteful in terms of transport and skill if these are not performed in-house. The need for a more user friendly and intuitive simulation experience requires clarity for potential manufacturers in order to adopt this methodology. Not enough varied Lean manufacturing companies embody Lean principles on a computational software level and as a result could potentially leave entire generations without modern manufacturing skill sets. The concept of VR used in modern Manufacturing Simulation Software (MSS) can be utilised to dispel any belief that VR is solely an entertainment medium. Through examination of Lean Principles and Video Game Development immersion strategies this research highlights the little recognized area of an Immersive Manufacturing Training and Design Testing Application. It is clear that Modern manufacturing environments need to become aware of Lean philosophies of adaptability. There is a requirement to inform companies about utilisation of the latest technologies in order to educate workforces in an efficient and Lean manner.

Although the dimensions inputted may be imprecise, this approach is useful for concept shape generation since at this stage dimensions need not be exact. The paper focuses on determining the requirements for the multimodal user interface and assessing the applications of different input and output mechanisms in the virtual environment (VE). Based on the results of these investigations, a VR-based computer-aided design (CAD) system for the conceptual shape design will be implemented in the current research.

The main contributions of the proposed system are about tiling, integration of the MPEG-Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard, and viewport-aware bitrate level selection. Tiling and adaptive streaming enable the proposed system to deliver very high-resolution 360° video at good visual quality. Further, the proposed viewport-aware bitrate assignment selects an optimum DASH representation for each tile in a viewport-aware manner.

Enabling widespread use of (also the real-time analysis) of bodily signals in VR applications could be a powerful method to design more user-centric, personalized VR experiences. However, technical and scientific challenges (e.g., cost of research-grade sensing devices, required coding skills, expert knowledge needed to interpret the data) complicate the integration of bodily data in existing interactive applications. This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of an open-source software framework named Excite-O-Meter.

Natural Interaction is the metaphor people encounter in reality: the direct manipulation of objects by their hands. To enable this kind of Natural Interaction, we propose a pseudo-physical metaphor that is both plausible enough to provide realistic interaction and robust enough to meet the needs of industrial applications. Our analysis of the most common types of objects in typical automotive scenarios guided the development of a set of refined grasping heuristics to support robust finger-based interaction of multiple hands and users. The objects' behavior in reaction to the users' finger motions is based on pseudo-physical simulations, which also take various types of constrained objects into account. In dealing with real-world scenarios, we had to introduce the concept of Normal Proxies, which extend objects with appropriate normals for improved grasp detection and grasp stability. An expert review revealed that our interaction metaphors allow for an intuitive and reliable assessment of several functionalities of objects found in a car interior.","2375-5334","978-1-4244-6238-4","10.1109/VR.2010.5444819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5444819","Direct Interaction;Immersive Applications","Virtual reality;Grasping;Robustness;Automotive engineering;Robust stability;Fingers;Object detection;Virtual environment;Hardware;Electrical equipment industry","automotive engineering;haptic interfaces;human computer interaction;product development;virtual reality","functional validation;virtual cars;natural interaction metaphors;virtual environments;automotive product development;metaphor people encounter;realistic interaction;industrial applications;automotive scenarios;grasping heuristics;robust finger-based interaction;user finger motions;pseudo-physical simulations;real-world scenarios;normal proxies;grasp detection;grasp stability;pseudophysical metaphor","","14","","11","IEEE","8 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to computational or latency constraints, it might not be possible to stitch multiview videos into a single video sequence prior to encoding. In this paper we investigate the coding and streaming of multiview VR video content. We present a standard-compliant method where we first divide the camera views into two types: Primary views represent a subset of camera views with lower resolution and non-overlapping (minimally overlapping) content which cover the entire 360-degree field-of-view to guarantee immediate monoscopic viewing during very rapid head movements. Auxiliary views consist of remaining camera views with higher resolution which produce overlapping content with the primary views and are additionally used for stereoscopic viewing. Based on this categorization, we propose a coding arrangement in which, the primary views are independently coded in the base layer and the additional auxiliary views are coded as an enhancement layer, using inter-layer prediction from primary views. The proposed system not only meets the low latency requirements of VR systems, but also conforms to the existing multilayer extensions of the High Efficiency Video Coding standard. Simulation results show that the coding and streaming performance of the proposed scheme is significantly improved compared to earlier methods.","","978-1-5090-4571-6","10.1109/ISM.2016.0065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7823632","Virtual Reality;Multiview Video Coding;Selective Streaming","Cameras;Encoding;Streaming media;Standards;Complexity theory;Bit rate;Decoding","image sequences;stereo image processing;video coding;video streaming;virtual reality","standard-compliant multiview video coding;standard-compliant multiview video streaming;virtual reality systems;multiview cameras;camera rigs;single video sequence;multiview VR video content streaming;standard-compliant method;multiview VR video content coding;camera views;primary views;monoscopic viewing;auxiliary views;stereoscopic viewing;coding arrangement;base layer;enhancement layer;interlayer prediction;VR systems;high efficiency video coding standard","","9","","12","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, providing wireless VR users with seamless connectivity and real-time VR video with high quality is challenging due to its requirements in high Quality of Experience (QoE) and low VR interaction latency under limited computation capability of VR device. To address these issues, we propose a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)-enabled wireless VR network, where the field of view (FoV) of each VR user can be real-time predicted using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and the rendering of VR content is moved from VR device to MEC server with rendering model migration capability. Taking into account the geographical and FoV request correlation, we propose Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) strategies to maximize the long-term QoE of VR users under VR interaction latency constraint. Simulation results show that our proposed MEC rendering schemes and DRL algorithms substantially improve the long-term QoE of VR users and reduce the VR interaction latency compared to MEC rendering with nearest association scheme.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473847","Field of view (FoV) prediction;rendering;downlink transmission;mobile edge computing (MEC);deep reinforcement learning (DRL);virtual reality (VR)","Solid modeling;Recurrent neural networks;Conferences;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Predictive models;Streaming media","deep learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;real-time systems;recurrent neural nets;rendering (computer graphics);user experience;virtual reality","wireless VR users;VR device;VR interaction latency constraint;MEC rendering;mobile edge computing-enabled wireless VR network;wireless-connected virtual reality;MEC-enabled wireless virtual reality network;decoupled learning;immersive user experience;field of view;quality of experience;recurrent neural network;deep reinforcement learning;user experience;VR content rendering;real time VR video","","2","","12","IEEE","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most cumbersome tasks when creating a VR application is the authoring of content, more specific the animation of characters and interactable objects. This paper describes the prototype for a Virtual Reality-supported learning and training application and presents a concept to simplify the authoring process of content with additional focus on animating assembly procedures. Our idea is to record actions performed by an expert in the VR environment.

At the same time, following the SoE is assisting the developers to make more immersive and striking VR experiences. At this publication's date, one of the cheapest ways to engage in VR experiences is through a smartphone, but although its technology is rapidly evolving, smartphones can only provide a fraction of the SoE experience, since they lack sensors capable of tracking more than merely the position and rotation of a user's head. This work presents an approach to provide a SoE experience in virtual reality for mobile devices through the union of the technologies Google VR and Leap Motion controller.

However, transmission of 360 video over the network is challenging due to its large size. To reduce the network bandwidth requirement of 360-degree video, Viewport Adaptive Streaming (VAS) has been proposed. A key issue in VAS is how to estimate future user viewing directions. In this paper, we carry out an evaluation of typical viewport estimation methods for VAS. It is found that Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)based method achieves the best trade-off between the accuracy and redundancy. Using cross-user behaviors achieve the highest accuracy at the expense of high redundancy. Meanwhile, the widely used linear regression-based method has performance comparable to that of the simple method using the last viewport position. In addition, we also found that all considered methods suffer significant degradation in performance when the prediction horizon increases beyond 1 second.","","978-1-6654-9475-5","10.1109/ICBIR54589.2022.9786513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9786513","Virtual Reality;360-degree Video;Viewport Estimation","Measurement;Degradation;Redundancy;Linear regression;Estimation;Virtual reality;Streaming media","recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;video cameras;video signal processing;video streaming;virtual reality","viewport adaptive streaming;VAS;viewport estimation methods;linear regression-based method;360-degree video streaming;virtual reality systems;network bandwidth requirement;long-short term memory based method;cross-user behaviors;prediction horizon","","1","","24","IEEE","8 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This high data rate over short transmission distances may be achieved via the abundant spectrum in the terahertz (THz) band. However, THz waves suffer from severe signal attenuation, which may be compensated by the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology with adjustable phase-shift of each reflecting element. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper, we propose an RIS-assisted THz VR network in an indoor scenario, taking into account the viewpoint prediction and downlink transmission. We first propose a genie-aided online gated recurrent unit (GRU) and integration of online long-short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to predict the viewpoint, location, and the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) statuses of the VR users over time, with the aim to optimize the long-term QoE of the VR users. We then develop a constrained deep reinforcement learning algorithm to select the optimal phase shifts of the RIS for the downlink transmission under latency constraints.

However, such requirements hinder the practical application of such models on mobile devices or in other embedded computing contexts.

The mathematical model for sensory perception has been developed for touch, but not for Nose (smell) and tongue (taste). The field of Haptics is related to simulating the touch. Touch is the most prominent sense to perceive the real world. A sense of touch gives the feeling of the physical properties of the object. Over the last decades, many theories have been put forward to simulate the touch artificially in computers to feel the virtual world (objects) physical properties. The evolvement of a cost-effective real-time One Degree of Freedom Haptic device with minimum hardware resources is aimed at this paper. The system is a build-up of three phases: System Hardware, System Software, and incorporating both in FPGA as a complete closed-loop solution.

The paper overviews some definitions for these and discusses the communicative aspects of gestures. The abovementioned paradigms affect the process of interaction design, which has to be even more thorough, more conscious than before. If we use gestures for input, the actual requirements of the application have to be analyzed in detail and decision about gesture “vocabulary” has to be taken.

Nevertheless, in spite of some of the lowest input costs in the developed world, the industry is blighted by over specification, and high output costs. Most components used on site are tailor made for the project in response to the designer's specific requirements. They are nearly all small, provide little repetition and are designed without regard for manufacturing or assembly efficiency. This interface is but one in a fragmented industry split between clients, architects and design engineers, manufacturers and building contractors. Contractual and legal constraints further discourage integration. If the EPSRC is to make a significant contribution towards transforming the above situation it will be important to plan on a large scale and concentrate on research of the highest quality and ingenuity. The overall grand design could be for selected universities to work towards developing a series of expert systems fully integrated into a prestigious ""client friendly"" advanced construction design centre which would exploit virtual reality. It would include an intelligent computer aided design system and would ultimately contain a wide range of software tools associated with every aspect of construction and ancillary processes.<>","","","10.1049/ic:19950838","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=405219","","Buildings;Construction industry;Government factors;Intelligent design assistants;Virtual reality","building;construction industry;government policies;intelligent design assistants;research initiatives;virtual reality","IT research;manufacturing process;EPSRC;Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council;UK construction;fragmented industry;architects;design engineers;building contractors;legal constraints;universities;expert systems;client friendly advanced construction design centre;virtual reality;intelligent computer aided design system;software tools;construction","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In these applications it is also common to use 4K resolution or higher per view for 360-degree videos. Consequently, this leads to technical challenges in handling the bandwidth requirements while keeping the system latency to the minimal. When the content is viewed with a HMD, a subset of the entire 360-degree video is displayed at a single point of time. To improve the resolution and picture quality of the displayed content, viewport based coding is desirable. In this regard, we investigated various viewport dependent projection schemes including the existing variants of Pyramidal projection. In this regard we propose the multi-resolution versions of Equirectangular and Cubemap projections. Additionally, we developed a methodology for comparing the rate-distortion performance of these projections. Based on the simulation results, it was observed that multi-resolution projections of Equirectangle and Cubemap outperform other projection schemes, significantly.","","978-1-5090-4571-6","10.1109/ISM.2016.0126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7823693","Virtual Reality;Environmental Mapping;View-adaptive Coding","Streaming media;Face;Encoding;Bit rate;Cameras;Resists","helmet mounted displays;image resolution;stereo image processing;video coding;video streaming;virtual reality","viewport-adaptive encoding;360-degree video streaming;virtual reality applications;head mount displays;stereoscopic capabilities;bandwidth requirements;video resolution;picture quality;viewport dependent projection;pyramidal projection;equirectangular projections;cubemap projections;multiresolution projections","","77","7","9","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper aims to examine the impact of (VM) on mitigating risks and costs management of R&D activities which support the FoF. As well as, the study performed a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to determine the importance of improving R&D activities in FoF. There are many criteria used to assess the impacts of (VM) on costs management of R&D activities and decrease the risks in FoF. The experimental results of this work showed that the full application of (VM) technique in R&D activities leads to almost 99 % performance improvement whereas the partial application of VM leads to improvement by 68.7 %. Thus, this paper is considered one of the best contributions which provide an evaluation of impact of VM on R&D activities to meet changing customer requirements.

However, the more complex the model is, the greater number of mesh control nodes, which greatly increases the complexity of mesh deformation. In this paper, the deformation of 3D virtual character model is studied based on the method of image topological deformation. In order to solve the problem of large number of network nodes in 3D model, the Laplace deformation method is further combined to reduce the number of control nodes in the network.

This kind of monotonous shopping environment not only makes consumers lose their interest in shopping but also restricts personalized services to consumers such as providing healthier alternatives to the products or providing with suggestions based on their past shopping pattern [1]. Keeping these issues in mind the prototype of a VR based game “Virtual Bazar” is proposed which allows its users to shop in a Virtual Reality supermarket environment. The proposed model keeps a check on the Calorie requirements set by the user, shows Nutritional Information of products and create awareness for Healthier Products. It consists of two runs, in the first run users add items to their cart based on their desires with no warnings and nutritional values being shown. In the second run users are shown Nutritional information regarding products along with warnings on products having high Sugar or Carbohydrate values and with these suggestions the user again adds items to the cart. Based on the items of the two shopping lists, separate scores are calculated and analyzed. 50 different people within the age bracket of 20–35 years have played this game and ANNOVA Test has been performed on the scores obtained by these players. The results suggest that the players were benefited by the game as they learnt to choose healthier products.","","978-1-6654-3722-6","10.1109/ICI53355.2022.9786879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9786879","COVID;calories;healthier alternative;hypothesis;virtual shopping experience;ANNOVA","COVID-19;Pandemics;Electronic commerce;Behavioral sciences;Games;Virtual reality;Informatics;Customer behavior;Games","food products;medical computing;retail data processing;serious games (computing);statistical testing;virtual reality","nutritional values;shopping lists;healthier products;healthier food choices;online shopping platforms;monotonous shopping environment;personalized services;healthier alternatives;shopping pattern;VR based game;nutritional information;virtual reality supermarket environment;simple two-dimensional image interface;Virtual Bazar;interactive virtual reality store;text-based interface;ANNOVA test;time 20.0 year to 35.0 year","","","","21","IEEE","7 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By controlling the horizontal movement of the left and right views, parallax is continuously and slowly adjusted within comfort zone. This can alleviate the static fixation of the eyes to the fixed distance of the display, relieving visual discomfort and reducing the degree of visual impairment. The experimental results show that dynamic parallax can alleviate the visual discomfort of watching videos in HMD and reduce the potential adverse effects on eyesight to some extent. Moreover, the uniform variation parallax has a better effect than the jump parallax.","","978-1-7281-6532-5","10.1109/VRW50115.2020.00243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9090635","General and reference;Cross-computing tools and techniques;Evaluation;Computing methodologies;Computer graphics;Graphics systems and interfaces;Virtual reality","Fatigue;Stereo image processing;Three-dimensional displays;Videos;Head-mounted displays","","","","","","17","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, there is the need to develop Virtual Reality (VR) simulators with sufficiently dynamic bases so that the training manager can configure and simulate a set of different machines, without needing expensive development processes that usually result in the reformulation of the developed system foundations in order to adapt to new needs. This paper proposes a generic and reconfigurable virtual reality system, capable of simulating the operation of different types of machines and suitable to be used in the training of workers for the operation of the various machines, for instance the ones present in an entire production line. The proposed approach is based on the use of a specification language that describes both the physical and behavioral characteristics of the machines to be simulated. A specification file, written using this language, is fed to the VR simulator that interprets its content and builds, automatically, the corresponding virtual reality environment, which can be used by the trainees to operate the machine(s). This approach allows using the same VR simulator to simulate any machine. A prototype of the VR system was built and applied in a test scenario. The results reveal that the development of systems with dynamic bases is promising and deserving of future work to build a more complete and flexible VR simulation system.","","978-1-7281-6378-9","10.1109/ICGI47575.2019.8955044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955044","virtual reality;simulator;generic;reconfigurable;industry;machine","Solid modeling;Training;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual environments;Specification languages;Engines","computer simulation;production engineering computing;production equipment;specification languages;virtual reality","generic reality system;specification language;specification file;VR simulator;VR system;industrial equipment virtual simulators;Virtual Reality simulators;reconfigurable virtual reality simulation system;production line;generic virtual reality simulation system","","","","8","IEEE","14 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we leverage the benefits of immersive head-mounted displays (HMDs) and present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a collaborative VR application for tactical resource planning on spatial data. We derived system and design requirements from consultations with domain experts and observations of a military on-site staff exercise, a simulation-based training aiming to strengthen rapid decision-making and teamwork during a time of crisis. To evaluate our prototype, we conducted semi-structured interviews with domain experts who organized and observed field tests at different military staff exercises. The interviews support the proposed design of the prototype and show general design implications for planning tools in VR.

However, traditional video streaming is not suitable for VR video because of the huge size and view switch requirements of VR videos. Since the view of each user is limited, it is unnecessary to send the whole 360-degree scene at high quality which can be a heavy burden for the transmission system. Assuming filed-of-view (FoV) of each user can be predicted with high probability, we can divide the video screen into partitions and send those partitions which will appear in FoV at high quality. Hence, we propose an novel strategy for VR video streaming. First, we define a quality-of-experience metric to measure the viewing experience of users and define a channel model to reflect the fluctuation of the wireless channel. Next, we formulate the optimization problem and find its feasible solution by convex optimization. In order to improve bandwidth efficiency, we also add adaptive modulation to this part. Finally, we compare our algorithm with other VR streaming algorithm in the simulation. It turns out that our algorithm outperforms other algorithms.","2377-8644","978-1-7281-0732-5","10.1109/ICCChina.2019.8855916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855916","virtual reality;FoV prediction;QoE optimization;convex optimization;adaptive modulation","Streaming media;Quality of experience;Modulation;Measurement;Optimization;Wireless communication;Bandwidth","adaptive modulation;convex programming;image sensors;video signal processing;video streaming;virtual reality;wireless channels","adaptive modulation;virtual reality;filed-of-view;FoV;video screen;VR video streaming;quality-of-experience metric;VR streaming algorithm;VR video;convex optimization","","3","","10","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The human response to this exposure has been categorized and mitigated via countermeasures, principally exercise. However, additional constraints to future mission design minimizes the allotted space and modalities for exercise, creating a risk for psychological fatigue, a reduction in motivation, and a suite of other categorical factors that could, taken together, present a risk for reduced adherence to the countermeasures and/or mission performance. Thus, the current study will examine the effects of a virtual reality (VR) intervention on spaceflight-validated exercise protocols using a prototype rowing ergometer designed to operate within the constraints of future long-duration exploration missions (LDEM). The Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training (dubbed “SPRINT”) protocol will be used in conjunction with a combination flywheel and resistance training device (M-MED) utilized in prior bedrest studies. The SPRINT protocol trades exercise duration for intensity, providing similar benefits to existing countermeasures while reducing time spent on exercise. The M - MED permits resistance training on the muscles most effected by microgravity exposure on the same device used to train cardiovascular function, thus reducing the volume and weight requirements of the exercise countermeasure. It is upon this framework that we will add the VR rowing simulation. VR has shown to be a lightweight, reliable, and enjoyable technology in numerous studies, while exergaming has been shown to improve measures of motivation and adherence. We will create a rowing simulation that can integrate with a rowing ergometer and any exercise protocol, and then implement it on the M-MED with SPRINT. The simulation will feature virtual teammates, virtual competitors, and other gaming mechanisms that encourage a user to maintain a prescribed heart rate intensity in a way that aims to maximize factors associated with enjoyment and adherence. We plan to conduct a within-subjects experiment on an astronaut-like population. Subjects will be randomly assigned to VR or non-VR in their initial experiment, complete the SPRINT protocol on the M-MED, break for a one-month minimum washout period, then return to complete the protocol again in the other group. As a pilot study, dependent variables have been selected broadly. Physical and psychological outcomes are to be measured alongside adherence to and motivation toward this very challenging protocol. Additional measures are to be made of virtual presence, preexisting bias toward or against VR, and personality traits, which may influence a preference for or against VR. Preliminary data on non-VR subjects shows increasing measures of state-trait anxiety, negative feelings toward the exercise, and amotivation from the start to the end of the protocol. It is hypothesized that overall attitudes toward the protocol will improve with the VR intervention as indicated by metrics of adherence, motivation, affect, and mood restoration. The results of this study will inform future designs of exercise combined with VR applications for implementation during LDEM.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438234","Texas A&M University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438234","","Training;Solid modeling;Protocols;Space missions;Sociology;Virtual reality;Extraterrestrial measurements","interactive systems;psychology;sport;virtual reality","exergaming;psychological fatigue;VR intervention;virtual competitors;virtual teammates;VR rowing simulation;exercise countermeasure;microgravity exposure;SPRINT protocol;M-MED;resistance training device;combination flywheel;aerobic training;integrated resistance;long-duration exploration missions;prototype rowing ergometer;spaceflight-validated exercise protocols;virtual reality intervention;categorical factors;microgravity environments;interactive virtual reality environments","","5","","58","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, existing technologies like graphics capabilities, processing power and network bandwidth, are permanently evolving. For MUVE systems to be successfully developed, they must not only deal with all the different aspects that are inherent to these systems but also have the ability to deal with the continuous technology and requirements evolution. To cope with these problems, a software engineering separation of concerns approach is proposed. Concerns are identified for each of the different aspects of MUVEs. To obtain the necessary flexibility, each one of the concerns should abstract its possible variations in order to support the future system evolution.

In this work, a virtual city environment was developed with intend to help city navigation especially by personnel with special abilities, mainly while traveling. They may need assistance to perform such daily tasks. The goal is to build an agent that can be trained to help guide daily commute from a given source to destination, optimizing for a minimum possible time as well as avoiding multiple obstacles. Real-time traffic and crowd were simulated to train learning agents. Apart from using the shortest path, factors such as following traffic rules and avoiding accidents with obstacles are also considered. The agent must be trained in order to avoid heavy traffic and change its path to reach the goal taking minimum time, not just the shortest distance. By using machine learning gents and simulations, training of the agent using reinforcement learning has been achieved. Identification of certain unsafe paths and behaviors have also been considered for simulation and learning purposes. Custom scenarios to mitigate the risks before actual accidents happen have been created for understanding and further resolution. Agent-based learning for successful space exploration is established on the relationship parameter between actions and the virtual environment. Initially, the agent explores the virtual city on its own and interacts with numerous components of the environment. The main objective of the agent is to reach its goal following the reward system, as used in a game environment. Maximization of the score using these parameters helps in training the agent. Route learning is also considered to facilitate backtracking wherein the obstacles are placed in the route. The virtual environment, so created, then has an agent that depicts that shorted, safe and accident-free path for a person to reach his or her destination from a given source point. The city has numerous parameters of an actual live city of building, paths, and unruly movements, amongst others.","","978-1-7281-6644-5","10.1109/ComPE49325.2020.9199993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9199993","Virtual Reality;Machine Learning Agent;Optimized Route Finding;Collision Detection;Collision avoidance;virtual bot;First Person Camera;Sustainable Development;City Navigation","Navigation;Training;Urban areas;Virtual environments;Learning (artificial intelligence);Task analysis;Games","accident prevention;collision avoidance;computer games;learning (artificial intelligence);navigation;traffic engineering computing;virtual reality","virtual environment;game environment;auto-navigation;virtual reality;sustainability requirements;virtual city environment;city navigation;shortest path;traffic rules;accident avoidance;machine learning;reinforcement learning;agent-based learning","","","","25","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VR based natural inputs systems are scarce, and the available ones are expensive. Again, very few of them translates the normal hand movements into the virtual control inputs. Therefore, the objective is to design and develop a wearable input system for controlling VR with enhanced usability and high accuracy. To attain this objective, user requirements were firstly elicited through semi-structured interviews. Then, a cost-effective and usable wearable system (VR Glove) was developed based on the revealed requirements for controlling VR. Finally, the system was evaluated with 20 test-participants (novice and expert); and it was found that the VR Glove was usable both to the novice and expert users, though the system was more usable to experts than the novice users. Participants were comfortable with the working mechanism of the proposed VR Glove system and also found the system very responsive.","","979-8-3503-4602-2","10.1109/ICCIT57492.2022.10054673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054673","Virtual Reality;Human Computer Interaction;Usability;Virtual Input;User Requirement","Training;Video games;Flexible printed circuits;Three-dimensional displays;Tracking;Virtual environments;Control systems","human factors;virtual reality","controlling VR;enhanced usability;expert users;intuitive control;natural control;virtual control inputs;virtual input system;virtual reality;VR based natural input systems;VR Glove system;wearable input system","","","","24","IEEE","3 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The widespread application of wireless VR in people's production, life, and so on, requires joint utilization of mobile network resources. However, the high dynamics of multi-dimensional resources bring severe challenges to improve the quality of experience (QoE) of wireless VR users. This challenge can be largely addressed by a recent network architecture known as mobile edge computing (MEC) network, which enables caching and computing at the edge of mobile networks. In this paper, we propose a wireless VR-oriented task offloading and resource management scheme which jointly considers caching, computing and spectrum allocation to minimize the content delivery delay under the promise of QoE requirements. To solve the problem, we decompose the original problem into two complex integer nonlinear programming (INLP) sub-problems. To solve the INLP problem, a proactive caching algorithm is proposed to determine the VR video's caching status. Then, a graph coloring method based on a greedy strategy is proposed to solve the remaining problem, which includes computation offloading and RB allocation decision. In the simulations, the delivery delay and the offloading capacity are evaluated. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","","978-1-7281-8635-1","10.1109/ICCC51575.2020.9345178","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:N171602002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345178","VR video streaming;quality of experience;mobile edge computing;resource allocation","Wireless communication;Simulation;Delays;Resource management;Quality of experience;Task analysis;Videos","cache storage;graph colouring;integer programming;mobile computing;mobile radio;nonlinear programming;resource allocation;virtual reality","resource allocation;wireless VR systems;wireless virtual reality;entry point;widespread application;people;joint utilization;mobile network resources;multidimensional resources;wireless VR users;recent network architecture;mobile edge computing network;mobile networks;wireless VR-oriented task offloading;resource management scheme;spectrum allocation;content delivery delay;QoE requirements;complex integer nonlinear programming sub-problems;INLP problem;proactive caching algorithm;VR video;remaining problem;computation offloading;offloading capacity","","3","","16","IEEE","12 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this regard, one can speak of cyberart: it is a very expansive concept that includes the creation of interactive worlds. These worlds, by definition, need a way for users to become part of the art piece by modifying it trough time. Interactive techniques commonly used when developing human computer interfaces (HCI) for traditional virtual reality applications are not always suited for art applications. This is so because each art installation is unique and reflects the artist's point of view.

To provide premium quality of experience, VR streaming faces unique challenges due to the significantly increased bandwidth consumption. To address the bandwidth challenge, VR video viewport prediction has been proposed as a viable solution, which predicts and streams only the user’s viewport of interest with high quality to the VR device. However, most of the existing viewport prediction approaches target only the video-on-demand (VOD) use cases, requiring offline processing of the historical video and/or user data that are not available in the live streaming scenario. In this work, we develop a novel viewport prediction approach for live VR streaming, which only requires video content and user data in the current viewing session. To address the challenges of insufficient training data and real-time processing, we propose a live VR-specific deep learning mechanism, namely LiveDeep, to create the online viewport prediction model and conduct real-time inference. LiveDeep employs a hybrid approach to address the unique challenges in live VR streaming, involving (1) an alternate online data collection, labeling, training, and inference schedule with controlled feedback loop to accommodate for the sparse training data; and (2) a mixture of hybrid neural network models to accommodate for the inaccuracy caused by a single model. We evaluate LiveDeep using 48 users and 14 VR videos of various types obtained from a public VR user head movement dataset. The results indicate around 90% prediction accuracy, around 40% bandwidth savings, and premium processing time, which meets the bandwidth and real-time requirements of live VR streaming.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-5608-8","10.1109/VR46266.2020.00104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089486","Human-centered computing;Human computer interaction (HCI);Interaction paradigms;Virtual reality","Streaming media;Predictive models;Bandwidth;Real-time systems;Data models;Machine learning;Virtual reality","","","","13","","43","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current post-processing is processed separately from normal rendering by the graphics processing unit (GPU). As a result, the GPU needs to first render a high-resolution frame and then add the post-processing effects within a very short time frame. Our in-depth experimental results on commercial VR products demonstrate that the post-processing in VR applications extends the VR frame time by approximately 2X on average. Furthermore, the ever-increasing resolution requirements of modern VR significantly increase the workloads for post-processing in the execution pipeline. This long delay causes VR real-time execution to frequently miss the critical frame-time deadline, thus hurting users’ quality of experience.Based on the analysis of VR post-processing workflow and its common realistic effects, we observe that post-processing shares the same hardware pipeline with normal rendering, and even reuses the intermediate data produced by normal rendering. To fully utilize this hardware-level similarity and capture the data locality, we propose a novel universal realistic rendering architecture for VR, named Post0-VR, which eliminates post-processing by directly merging the common realistic effects into the normal rendering process. Based on our newly proposed VR architecture design, we further propose a dynamic accuracy adjustment method to simplify the normal rendering without hurting users’ perception. The evaluation results on real-world applications demonstrate that Post0-VR can support different types of realistic effects while significantly improving the overall VR rendering performance.","2378-203X","978-1-6654-7652-2","10.1109/HPCA56546.2023.10071097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071097","","Pipelines;Merging;Graphics processing units;Computer architecture;Virtual reality;Quality of service;Rendering (computer graphics)","graphics processing units;image resolution;real-time systems;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","commercial VR products;common realistic effects;critical frame-time deadline;current post-processing;enabling universal realistic rendering;graphics processing unit;high-resolution frame;modern VR systems;named Post0-VR;normal rendering process;numerous realistic effects;post-processing effects;post-processing shares;render;short time frame;universal realistic rendering architecture;VR applications;VR frame time;VR post-processing workflow;VR rendering performance","","","","94","IEEE","24 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the isolation and quarantine requirements and the increased international collaboration, virtual classes have become a staple of today's curricula. Our work builds on the Vis-ible Human Projects for Virtual Dissection material and provides a medium for groups of students to do collaborative anatomical dissections in real-time using sketching and 3D visualizations and audio coupled with interactive 2D tablets for precise drawing. We describe the system architecture, compare requirements with those of a previous development [1] and discuss the preliminary results. Discussions with Anatomists show that this is an effective tool. We introduce avenues for further research and discuss collaboration challenges posed by this context.","","978-1-6654-8402-2","10.1109/VRW55335.2022.00097","Portuguese Govt.

However, 360-degree videos suffer from bandwidth limits. Existing bandwidth-efficient solutions mainly focus on spatially cutting 360-degree video into tiles, and only provide video content in the Field-of-View (FoV) of users with high quality to reduce bandwidth consumption. Although existing tile-based schemes can reduce the bandwidth consumption, the bandwidth and transmission delay provided by a single-path TCP may still not meet the high requirements of 360-degree videos. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) allows a TCP connection to operate across multiple paths simultaneously and becomes highly attractive to support the mobile devices with various radio interfaces to aggregate multipath bandwidth and improve the throughput. In this paper, by taking the advantage of MPTCP, we propose an MPTCP-based adaptive streaming framework for 360-degree Virtual Reality videos, named MP-VR. MP-VR dynamically selects the appropriate tile bitrate according to the bandwidth and transmission delay of different subflows. Then it schedules the video segments to subflows to improve QoE of users. We conduct experiments on a testbed in our lab and simulations on NS-3. Evaluation results show that MP-VR outperforms existing tile-based strategies when network fluctuations or errors in FoV predictions occur.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500817","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Youth Innovation Promotion Association; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500817","Multipath TCP;360-degree videos;Tiles;Scheduling","Schedules;Solid modeling;Simulation;Bit rate;Bandwidth;Virtual reality;Throughput","delays;mobile radio;transport protocols;video coding;video signal processing;video streaming;virtual reality","video segments;transmission delay;bandwidth consumption;video content;360-degree video;standard streaming video;video experience;360-degree virtual reality videos;MPTCP-based adaptive streaming framework;MP-VR","","4","","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Internet of Radio Light (IoRL) project presents a 5G architecture that could further enhance VR experiences by bridging gaps between various VR technologies and reducing current restrictions. This could enable a single IoRL VR system, capable of combining the significant processing performance of PC operated VR systems with similar physical freedoms offered by standalone VR headsets, as well as delivering equally impressive VR experiences to mobile users. Most notably, the IoRL project combines both Visible Light Communication (VLC) and mmWave technology to produce an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) which, as presented in earlier works, poses an opportunity for a novel VR tracking method. This paper explores the possibilities of an IoRL VR system and proposes a model and solution to evaluate the concept validity. The obtained results reflect that while this system is effective for 5G wireless localisation, further work is required to meet VR requirements.","2155-5052","978-1-7281-5784-9","10.1109/BMSB49480.2020.9519726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519726","5G;Virtual Reality (VR);mobile;Indoor Positioning System (IPS);Tracking;Visible Light Communications (VLC);mmWave;Ultra low latency;Internet of Radio Light (IoRL)","Wireless communication;Location awareness;Solid modeling;5G mobile communication;Virtual reality;Hybrid power systems;Internet","5G mobile communication;free-space optical communication;indoor communication;indoor radio;Internet of Things;millimetre wave communication;virtual reality","virtual reality systems;processing power;IoRL project;5G VR systems;Internet of Radio Light;5G networking;5G architecture;visible light communication;VLC;mmWave technology;millimeter wave technology;indoor positioning system;IPS;5G wireless localisation","","","","41","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is often overlooked due to cost and time constraints. Usability inspection methods were developed to cut cost and time compared to traditional usability evaluation. However, they still bring with them certain requirements such as having multiple designers involved in the evaluation. Inspection techniques have also been shown to be difficult to learn and teach. With software development projects becoming increasingly distributed, it is ever more difficult to have sufficient participants in a usability inspection and to collaboratively learn the techniques. Motivated by these problems, we developed a novel, prototype environment called INspect-World for distributed usability inspection techniques. INspect-World is built on top of the virtual world platform OpenSimulator. As we investigate usability inspections performed in this environment, we also address ideas of human-centered end-user development in mediated communication contexts.","","978-1-4673-1824-2","10.1109/CHASE.2012.6223027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6223027","Distributed usability analysis;usability inspection techniques;virtual worlds;distributed teams;computer-supported cooperative work;human-computer interaction;software engineering","Usability;Inspection;Software engineering;Programming;Virtual environments;Human computer interaction;Collaboration","computer mediated communication;computer science education;groupware;human computer interaction;software reusability;virtual reality","distributed usability evaluation;virtual world platform;software development project;cost constraints;time constraints;collaborative learning;prototype environment;INspect-World;distributed usability inspection techniques;OpenSimulator;human-centered end-user development;computer mediated communication","","5","","14","IEEE","25 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have been experimenting with approaches to terra-scale, heterogeneous augmented reality mirror worlds, to unify these two worlds. Our focus has been on the authoring and user-experience, for example allowing ad-hoc transition between augmented and virtual reality interactions for multiple co-present users. This form of ubiquitous virtual reality raises several research questions involving the functional requirements, user affordances and relevant system architectures for these mirror worlds.

Using the ns-3 simulator, we validate our theoretical framework, and demonstrate that a properly configured IEEE 802.11ad AP can support at least 8 headsets receiving a 4K video stream for each eye, with transmission latency under 1 millisecond.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322284","Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO): PhD Fellowship(grant numbers:ISB0719N); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322284","","Resource management;Diffusion tensor imaging;Standards;Resists;Array signal processing;Wireless communication;Synchronization","helmet mounted displays;indoor communication;millimetre wave communication;multi-access systems;video streaming;virtual reality;wireless LAN","interactive multiuser VR;strict latency constraints;fully wireless headsets;commercially available solutions;proprietary millimeter wave communications technologies;extremely high frequencies;latency requirements;VR applications;specification-compliant IEEE 802.11ad hardware;wireless mmWave VR solutions;attainable live VR video bitrates;different IEEE 802.11ad channel access methods;properly configured IEEE 802.11ad AP;Wi-Fi;multiuser interactive virtual reality;stumbling block;high-fidelity virtual reality headsets","","5","","25","IEEE","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, today's digital work environments are often cumbersome and hard to use, and contribute to stress and ill-health with subsequent cost to the individual, to their employers and to society. Our long-term aim is to facilitate the development of IT systems that provide a healthy digital work environment by including a human factors and ergonomics (HFE) perspective in the requirements engineering (RE) process. IT systems can then be better adapted to professional users, rather than forcing them to adapt work processes to the tools provided. As a first step, we performed an exploratory case study of a recently implemented IT system at a major Nordic bank to identify relevant aspects of HFE to consider within RE. The study consisted of a literature review, observations and interviews. We present eight factors covering user support such as documentation and training, and system characteristics such as understandability, ease of learning, ease of remembering, user satisfaction, system interplay and work-process interplay. These initial results may support non-HFE experts in including these aspects in RE for digital work environments. The results are also a starting point for further research into incorporating HFE in RE.","","978-1-7281-8354-1","10.1109/REWBAH51211.2020.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216071","Requirements engineering;human factors;ergonomics;work environment","Interviews;Task analysis;Human factors;Stress;Tools;Bibliographies;Usability","banking;ergonomics;human factors;learning (artificial intelligence);virtual reality","Nordic bank;RE;HFE;ergonomics;requirements engineering process;healthy digital work environment;virtual environments;work places;digital technology;human factors;digital work environments;work-process interplay","","2","","54","IEEE","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an image analysis based view management method, which first adopts the image processing to superimpose 2D labels to the specific object. We then conduct three search space methods to an augmented reality scenario. Without the requirements of setting rules and constraints for occlusion among the labels, the results of three search space methods are evaluated by using objective analysis of related parameters. The evaluation results indicate that different search space methods could generate different time costs and occlusion, thereby affecting the final labelling effects.","2375-5334","978-1-5090-6647-6","10.1109/VR.2017.7892321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7892321","Augmented reality;labelling;search space","Labeling;Augmented reality;Search problems;Layout;Cameras;Two dimensional displays;Image edge detection","augmented reality;image representation;search problems","labelling layout;augmented reality;view management;image analysis;search space;adaptive representations;image processing","","1","","4","IEEE","6 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a time-independent model, where the software object is subjected to an a priori known test suite. The reliability of the software is the probability that it will function properly for values in the input space. Because the input space is usually very large, it is impossible to sample all input values, so in order to provide better sampling coverage, the input space is partitioned into homogeneous subspaces. Samples are drawn from each subspace for testing the software. The conformance tests based on these samples are required to pass all tests in the test suite. Based on these data, the classical statistical estimate of reliability is one. Such an estimate may be unrealistic if the sample sizes are not large.

However, the production of Ambisonics audio is difficult for the public because of the requirements of expensive equipments or professional music production ability. In this work, an end-to-end Ambisonics generator for panorama video is proposed. To improve the perception of directional sound, we assume that sound field is composed of a primary sound source and an ambient sound without spatiality, and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) based Primary Ambient Extractor (PAE) is proposed to separate the two parts of sound field. The directional sound is spatially encoded by the weights from audio-visual fusion network added by ambient part. Our network is evaluated with panorama video clips with first order Ambisonics.

To comply with these requirements, both networks and applications need to be dramatically improved.

Examples of this are the 5G paradigm or the advances on mechanisms of network precision control using network slicing, Software-defined networking solutions or novel service oriented protocols. On the other hand, Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming, which is the best-suited technology to provide the immersive visual feed of the Tactile Internet, is still far from the envisioned levels of real-timeliness and quality. The aim of this paper is to pinpoint the open challenges to enable VR video streaming technologies for the Tactile Internet. This paper first provides a thorough analysis of the state-of-the-art on VR video streaming technologies both, theoretically and by means of an experimental demonstrator.

But inappropriate use of risk assessment and decision making processes can still affect task completion during a project. New management methodologies must therefore be developed that enhance knowledge sharing by considering the viewpoints of more experts, supporting ad-hoc communications between partners and improving secured integration of technologies. Not only could time management become more efficient because the managers would have a broader, deeper understanding of the decisional context, but it could also minimise investment risks by enabling fast reactivity to any unforeseen issues. Based on the above requirements, the pro-active project management is introduced here as a solution to current project management limitations. It makes full use of advanced technologies, such as virtual reality, to enable knowledge sharing at any time between any members of a project. After an analysis of current issues, this paper thus introduces the pro-active project management methodologies and the technologies that enable its implementation.

Multi-access edge computing (MEC) network, providing caching and computing capacities at network edge, emerges as a promising method to support wireless VR. However, mobile VR users' quality of experience (QoE) may be degraded by frequent handoffs. In this paper, we propose a proactive caching, computing and communication (3C) resource allocation method to provide smooth VR videos to handoff users. Specifically, the expected 3-dimensional (3D) video or 2D video for rendering is cached at a target base station (BS) ahead of time, and the size and quality of the video file are decided according to the 3C resources at the BS. Then, we model the the proactive 3C resource allocation as a Markov decision process and an effective allocation policy is obtained by a model-free algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results show that the proposed method can provide VR users with high QoE when they are moving between BSs.","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685438","Wireless virtual reality;multi-access edge computing;resource allocation;deep reinforcement learning","Wireless communication;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Rendering (computer graphics);Numerical models","cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile computing;mobile radio;mobility management (mobile radio);resource allocation;virtual reality","handoff users;video file;proactive 3C resource allocation;effective allocation policy;deep reinforcement learning;wireless virtual reality;future mobile networks;existing mobile networks;massive data transmissions;ultra-low latency;wireless VR;multiaccess edge computing network;computing capacities;network edge;mobile VR users;smooth VR videos","","2","","13","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a system is a imitator of the visual situation, standing from a computer image generator and 3D indicator. However, the availability of modeling does not imply the need for system analysis to select the main nodes of the 3D modeling system. When training on the simulator, the driver interacts not with real objects, but with their models. Since it is impossible to create a complete model, in studying the simulator complex it is necessary to take into account the negative consequences of the “unreliability” of the synthesis of visible 3D models located in the 3D space model, in comparison with real analogues. The comparison was carried out in the study of the peculiarities of the decision making by the locomotive driver, while controlling the real locomotive, using the information obtained by viewing the terrain through the cab window. Studies have shown that in order to carry out a comparative analysis, it is necessary to develop criteria for assessing the imitator of the visual situation. It was determined that at present the main criterion for the successful modeling of a three-dimensional image in the locomotive operator's integrated simulator is the requirement to train professional skills in determining the distance to visible 3D models. Earlier similar tasks were investigated and successfully solved in aviation simulators. Their solution showed that such a problem can be solved using pseudo-3D 3D imaging systems. Two classes of 3D modeling systems are used: one-channel and two-channel. Each class allows the trainee to see 3D images of sufficient quality so that he can train his visual apparatus and use it to visually distance the selected object. Each class of 3D imaging systems will allow a person to see a 3D image due to exposure to certain components of the person's vision. Single-channel, needleless 3D modeling systems affect the accommodation and convergence of human vision. Two-channel effects on the disparity of human vision. Each 3D image modeling class has its disadvantages and advantages. The choice of a specific class of modeling 3D images is determined by the tasks set in the TOR for the simulator. After selecting the 3D simulation modeling class, it is necessary to determine the composition of the main nodes of the imitator of the visual situation in order to perform the tasks set in the TOR for the simulator. The article shows one of the possible methods for assessing the main nodes of the visual environment simulator, which allows to determine the composition of the optical-software-hardware simulation complex of the required 3D image for the train simulator of the locomotive driver. The quality of the formation of the information space should ensure the formation of the trainee's professional skills in locomotive management.","","978-1-5386-9535-7","10.1109/FarEastCon.2018.8602860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8602860","3D image simulation;simulator for training locomotive drivers;computer image generator;3D indicator","Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Visualization;Training;Optical imaging;Glass;Computational modeling","computer based training;data visualisation;image sensors;locomotives;solid modelling;user interfaces;virtual reality","visual situation;three-dimensional image;locomotive operator;aviation simulators;3D imaging systems;3D modeling system;visual apparatus;3D image modeling class;3D simulation modeling class;visual environment simulator;optical-software-hardware simulation complex;train simulator;locomotive driver;optical-hardware-software systems;three-dimensional visually observable space;training simulators;software complexes;simulator window;computer image generator;system analysis;simulator complex;3D space model;3D modeling systems","","1","","20","IEEE","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One approach for detecting the focal state is to use the link between vergence and accommodation and employ binocular gaze tracking to determine the depth of the fixation point; consequently, the focal depth is also known. In order to ensure the virtual image is in focus, the display must be set to a depth which causes no negative perceptual or physiological effects to the viewer, which indicates error bounds for the calculation of fixation point. I analyze the required gaze tracker accuracy to ensure the display focus is set within the viewer's depth of field, zone of comfort, and zone of clear single binocular vision. My findings indicate that for the median adult using an augmented reality varifocal display, gaze tracking accuracy must be better than 0.541°.

Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), where many VR terminals needed to be online at the same time, can hardly guarantee VR's bandwidth requirement. However, by making use of users' quality of experience (QoE) awareness factors, including the relative moving speed and depth difference between the viewpoint and other content, bandwidth consumption can be reduced. In this paper, we propose Optical Flow Based VR(OFB-VR), an interactive method of VR streaming that can make use of VR users' QoE awareness to ease the bandwidth pressure. The Just-Noticeable Difference through Optical Flow Estimation (JND-OFE) is explored to quantify users' awareness of quality distortion in 360° videos. Accordingly, a novel 360° videos QoE metric based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and JND-OFE (PSNR-OF) is proposed. With the help of PSNR-OF, OFB-VR proposes a versatile-size tiling scheme to lessen the tiling overhead. A Reinforcement Learning (RL) method is implemented to make use of historical data to perform Adaptive BitRate (ABR). For evaluation, we take two prior VR streaming schemes, Pano and Plato, as baselines. Vast evaluations show that our system can increase the mean PSNR-OF score by 9.5-15.8% while maintaining the same rebuffer ratio compared with Pano and Plato in a fluctuate LTE bandwidth dataset. Evaluation results show that OFB-VR is a promising prototype for actual interactive industrial VR.

In Virtual Reality Stress Therapy (VRST) application particularly in the proliferation towards the virtualization and simulation of the Traditional Foot Reflexology (FR) therapy, the multimodal human to human (H-to-H) interactivity involved in foot reflexology was identified and categorized by previous studies from which a design requirement and an interaction model were created. However, model validation using expert reviews is necessary before a final validated interaction model can be obtained. This will translate and lay the foundation for future FR VRST system design. This paper presents an expert review of the multi-modal H-to-H interaction model for FR VRST application using 8 experts from the HCI or related domain. The experts reviewed and gave feedback on the model, their reviews were utilized to reconstruct the multi-modal H-to-H interaction model, consequently yielding a final validated multimodal H-to-H interaction model for FR VRST application.

The filter principle can be evaluated on gantry crane 3D model by using virtual laboratory. The control aim is to avoid load oscillations during load transport. The shaping filter works as a band stop filter which attenuates the natural frequency by modifying setpoint changes. The 3D crane model development is based on Java3D package (rendering package) and a VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) Java loader which creates a bridge between the CAD system and the rendering engine.

A large number of IoT applications require continuous processing of data streams in real-time. Examples include virtual reality applications, connected autonomous vehicles and smart city applications. Although current distributed stream processing systems offer various forms of fault tolerance, existing schemes do not understand the dynamic characteristics of edge computing infrastructures and the unique requirements of edge computing applications. Optimizing fault tolerance techniques to meet latency requirements while minimizing resource usage becomes a critical dimension of resource allocation and scheduling when dealing with latency-sensitive IoT applications in edge computing. In this paper, we present a novel resilient stream processing framework that achieves system-wide fault tolerance while meeting the latency requirements for edge-based applications. The proposed approach employs a novel resilient physical plan generation for stream queries and optimizes the placement of operators to minimize the processing latency during recovery and reduces the overhead of checkpointing. We implement a prototype of the proposed techniques in Apache Storm and evaluate it in a real testbed. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is highly effective and scalable while ensuring low latency and low-cost recovery for edge-based stream processing applications.","","978-1-7281-9586-5","10.1109/CCGrid51090.2021.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9499609","Edge Computing;Stream Processing;Fault Tolerance;Scheduling","Checkpointing;Fault tolerance;Storms;Smart cities;Fault tolerant systems;Prototypes;Virtual reality","checkpointing;cluster computing;data analysis;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;Internet;Internet of Things;middleware;query processing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual reality","Internet-of-Things devices;low latency stream data;continuous processing;data streams;virtual reality applications;connected autonomous vehicles;smart city applications;current distributed stream processing systems;edge computing infrastructures;unique requirements;edge computing applications;fault tolerance techniques;latency requirements;resource usage minimization;resource allocation;scheduling;latency-sensitive IoT applications;resilient stream processing framework;system-wide fault tolerance;edge-based applications;resilient physical plan generation;stream queries;edge-based stream processing applications","","4","","28","IEEE","2 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most methods address this issue by first acquiring a large number of image samples from different viewpoints. However, this is often costly in both time and hardware requirements, and is incompatible with the growing selection of existing, casually-acquired 360-degree images available online. In this paper, we present a novel solution for cinematic VR with motion parallax that instead only uses a single monoscopic omnidirectional image as input. We provide new insights on how to convert such an image into a scene mesh, and discuss potential uses of this representation. We notably propose using a VR interface to manually generate a 360-degree depth map, visualized as a 3D mesh and modified by the operator in real-time. We applied our method to different real-world scenes, and conducted a user study comparing meshes created from depth maps of different levels of accuracy.

It is additionally complicated by complex system designs of Real-time Interactive Systems (RISs), required for Augmented, Mixed, and Virtual Reality, as well as computer games. If such systems incorporate AI methods, as required for the implementation of multimodal interfaces or smart environments, it is even further exacerbated. Existing approaches strive to establish software technical solutions to support the close temporal and semantic coupling required for multimodal processing and at the same time preserve a general decoupling principle between involved software modules. We present two key solutions that target the semantic coupling issue: (1) a semantics-based access scheme to principal elements of the application state and (2) the specification of effects by means of semantic function descriptions for multimodal processing. Both concepts are modeled in an OWL ontology. The applicability of our concepts is showcased by a prototypical implementation and explained by an interaction example that is applied for two application areas.","2328-7829","978-1-5090-4275-3","10.1109/SEARIS.2016.7551582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7551582","D.2.11 [Software Engineering]: Software Architectures—;H.5.2 [Interfaces and Presentation]: User Interfaces","Semantics;Couplings;Green products;Software;OWL;Ontologies;Interactive systems","interactive systems;knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);software quality;software reusability","semantics-based software techniques;maintainable multimodal input processing;real-time interactive systems;RISs;software reusability;software modifiability;software modularity;nonfunctional software quality requirement;AI methods;multimodal interfaces;temporal coupling;semantic coupling;semantics-based access scheme;semantic function descriptions;OWL ontology","","2","","29","IEEE","29 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, because of its high requirement of bandwidth, it is still challenge to transmit 360-degree video. To overcome this issue, tile-based VR transmission strategy was proposed to reduce the data by dividing the 360-degree video into several tiles and streaming corresponding tiles according to user's viewport. While the prediction accuracy is only guaranteed in a short time and it may cause frequent rebuffering when the network fluctuates, two-tier buffer system was proposed to tackle this problem. Nevertheless the two-tier method doesn't consider the switching frequency of rate in user's viewport. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical update buffer management method by jointly considering the probability of rebuffering and the switching frequency of rate in FoV to improve user's QoE.

However, computing and network-intensive utilization of resources require changes in cloud-based and traditional monolithic (single machine) deployments towards distributed edge computing architecture to enable high-quality interaction. Decomposing MUVR into elements with specialized Service Functions (SF) in order and organizing it into a Service Function Chaining (SFC) requests orchestration enables MUVR to reuse frame processing between users and improves MUVR scalability. However, orchestrating distributed edge computing resources and multiple destination SFCs while minimizing delay and meeting resource requirements is a challenging task. This article proposes a multi-criteria SFC orchestration scheme for MUVR services, called MuSFiCO. MuSFiCO maps edge computing resources and instantiates SFCs on distributed servers based on delays threshold, CPU and memory resources, and bandwidth. We developed a constrained-based heuristic to minimize delay and compare it with the baseline monolithic deployment and cloud-based SFC algorithms. Results demonstrate the efficiency of MuSFiCO compared to other approaches in terms of latency, CPU, memory, bandwidth utilization, as well as orchestration decision-time.","","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10000827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10000827","Service Function Chaining;Orchestration;Virtual Reality;Edge Computing","Cloud computing;Service function chaining;Scalability;Wireless networks;Bandwidth;Virtual reality;Delays","cloud computing;computer games;edge computing;entertainment;human computer interaction;quality of service;resource allocation;virtual reality","baseline monolithic deployment;cloud-based SFC algorithm;constrained-based heuristic;distributed edge computing resources;distributed server;distributed servers;frame processing;high-quality interaction;immersive entertainment;in-game interactions;memory resources;multicriteria service function chaining orchestration;multicriteria SFC orchestration scheme;multiple destination SFC;multiuser virtual reality services;MuSFiCO;MUVR scalability;MUVR services;orchestration decision-time;service function chaining requests orchestration;traditional monolithic deployments","","","","14","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wiederhold","Interactive Media Institute, San Diego, CA, USA","2006 International Workshop on Virtual Rehabilitation","9 Oct 2006","2006","","","35","35","Summary form only given. Having incorporated advanced technologies into the practice of behavioral healthcare over the past decade, I have come to realize the power of these technologies in the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of a variety of disorders, ranging from specific phobias, to addictions, to physical injuries. What has also become apparent is the difficulty that many providers feel when incorporating a new technology into their existing protocols and practices. There are several factors which may contribute directly to this difficulty. One factor is space. Although we as technology adopters feel the space requirements are no longer overwhelming, the average psychologist only has a one room office. This room is already filled with a comfortable sofa, a chair, and possibly, though not always, one computer for basic internet and word-processing. In contrast, many VR clinics use ""augmented reality"" pieces for different phobias. For example, in a ""fear of flying"" room, there may be 4 airline seats, attached to a platform with subwoofers mounted underneath to help simulate motion during takeoff, turbulence and landing. In addition, there is one personal computer for the VR software, one computer and an adaptive device for the physiological monitoring and feedback, and then the head mounted display (HMD). As we move forward into the second decade of VR and behavioral healthcare, we may well see more adopters of technology as the cost barrier comes down. The space issues will not go away nor will the skill issues. It is our duty and our challenge as early adopters to educate others on the benefits of adding technology to existing protocols and practice. It is not always easy to get others to see the wisdom of this, but this should remain our goal","2331-9569","1-4244-0280-8","10.1109/IWVR.2006.1707523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1707523","","","health care;medical computing;patient monitoring;patient rehabilitation;psychology;virtual reality","virtual reality clinical practice;behavioral healthcare;augmented reality;personal computer;adaptive device;physiological monitoring;feedback;head mounted display","","","","","IEEE","9 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Five typical concurrency and synchronization schemes often found in concurrent Virtual Reality (VR) and computer game systems are identified as use-cases. These use-cases guide the development a) of software primitives necessary for the use-case implementation based on asynchronous RIS architectures and b) of a graphical editor for the specification of various concurrency and synchronization schemes (including the use-cases) based on these primitives. Several model-checking tools are evaluated against typical requirements in the RIS area. As a result, the formal model checking language Rebeca and its model checker RMC are applied to the specification of the use-cases to estimate latency and parallelism for each case. The estimations are compared to measured results achieved by classical profiling from a real-world application. The estimated results of the latencies by model checking approximated the measured results adequately with a minimal difference of 3.9% in the best case and -26.8% in the worst case. It also detected a problematic execution path not covered by the stochastic nature of the measured profiling samples. The estimated results of the degree of parallelization by model checking are approximated with an minimal difference of 9.3% and a maximal difference of -28.8%.

The quality of a surgery simulation is defined by how realistic it is in a physical sense. These physics aspects however have little to do the high-level functionalities of the application. Most VR (virtual reality) applications use libraries called physics engine for enforcing physics laws in their virtual worlds. Although the concept of using physics engines is ideal for development of VR applications, in practice it does impose many limitations. For instance, there are many physical laws in the world, and one single physics engine cannot provide all of them. In addition, each physical law can be implemented differently; some are optimized for fast response, others are designed for maximum precision. Most existing physics engines are specialized for common applications such as gaming, robotic or flight simulations. In surgery applications, the requirements are different; therefore different physics laws are needed. In particular, laws are needed for simulating cutting and skin deformation. In addition, these laws must be enforced with a high precision level. We discuss how xPheve was used to develop a cataract eye surgery simulation. xPheve is a physics engine that allows extension and customization of the simulation physics through development and integration of reusable law components. This work discusses how xPheve can benefit the development of the surgery simulations.","","0-7803-9376-7","10.1109/HAVE.2005.1545653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1545653","","Physics;Engines;Surgery;Medical simulation;Virtual reality;Libraries;Design optimization;Robots;Aerospace simulation;Deformable models","medical computing;digital simulation;physics computing;surgery;eye;virtual reality","physics engine;virtual reality;physics law;xPheve;cataract eye surgery simulation;simulation physics;reusable law component;software engineering","","6","","20","IEEE","12 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider that this method can suppress the image buffer size to send to the observer because each camera captures the omnidirectional image without lens rotation. This paper introduces the mechanical design of our camera system and its potential for visual telepresence through three experiments.

It was conceived as the next step in the evolution of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) transcending virtual reality into the physical space shared with the human interlocutor. Recently an attention module has been added as part of a behavioural control system for non-verbal interaction between robot/ECA and human. Unstructured incoming perceptual information (currently originating from a custom acoustic localisation algorithm and a commercial people tracking software) is narrowed down to the most salient aspects allowing the generation of a single motor response. The requirements of the current task determine what salient means at any point in time, that is, the rules and associated thresholds and weights of the attention system are modified by the requirements of the current task while the task itself is specified by the central control system depending on the overall state of the AH with respect to the ongoing interaction. The attention system determines a single attended event using a winner-takes-all strategy and relays it to the central control system. It also directly generates a motor goal and forwards it to the motor system. The video shows how the robot's attention system drives its behaviour, (1) when there is no stimulus over an extended period of time, (2) when a person moves within its visual field, and (3) when a sudden loud auditory event attracts attention during an ongoing visually-based interaction (auditory-visual attention conflict). The subtitles are direct mappings from numeric descriptions of the central control system's internal states to slightly more entertaining English sentences.","2167-2148","978-1-4244-4892-0","10.1109/HRI.2010.5453164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453164","attention model;multimodal;Embodied Conversational Agent;robot arm","Control systems;Centralized control;Orbital robotics;Laboratories;Australia;Service robots;Virtual reality;Human robot interaction;Software algorithms;Relays","centralised control;control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;industrial robots;interactive video;liquid crystal displays;virtual reality","articulated head;LCD monitor;industrial robot arm;embodied conversational agents;virtual reality;behavioural control system;unstructured incoming perceptual information;single motor response;robot attention system;visually-based interaction;central control system","","2","","","IEEE","22 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Immersive images / videos are becoming widely adopted to carry omnidirectional visual information. However, due to the requirements for higher spatial and temporal resolution of real video data, immersive videos require significantly larger bandwidth consumption. To reduce stresses on bandwidth, foveated video compression is regaining popularity, whereby the space-variant spatial resolution of the retina is exploited. Towards advancing the progress of foveated video compression, we propose a full reference (FR) foveated image quality assessment algorithm, which we call foveated entropic differencing (FED), which employs the natural scene statistics of bandpass responses by applying differences of local entropies weighted by a foveation-based error sensitivity function. We evaluate the proposed algorithm by measuring the correlations of the predictions that FED makes against human judgements on the newly created 2D and 3D LIVE-FBT-FCVR databases for Virtual Reality (VR). The performance of the proposed algorithm yields state-of-the-art as compared with other existing full reference algorithms.

Our VR system supports the workflow of digital restoration by offering a configurable self-arranging fragment wall. It supports the user to organize all fragments in an overview representation and to identify relevant fragments quickly. For assembly, we implemented a jigsaw approach comprising two sets of manipulation techniques that allow the user to roughly align fragments first in sub-puzzles and precisely assemble them in a second step.

In this paper, we provide a set of methods of aerial photography data acquisition and cluster-based 3D model reconstruction for large-scale scene. Firstly, for the data acquisition end, we adopt two strategies of track pre-planning and feedback-based trajectory planning to meet the requirements of efficient data acquisition.

Through the sweeping process, a large number of robust correspondences between the depth and the color image as well as the 3D world positions can be automatically established. In order to obtain temporally synchronized correspondences between an RGBD-sensor's data streams and the tracked target's positions we apply an off-line optimization process based on error minimization and a coplanarity constraint. The correspondences are entered into a 3D look-up table which is used during runtime to transform depth and color information into the application's world coordinate system.

To meet the VR delay requirements, the UAVs can extract specific visible content from the original 360° VR data and send this visible content to the users so as to reduce the traffic load over backhaul and radio access links. To further alleviate the UAV-SBS backhaul traffic, the SBSs can also cache the popular contents that users request. This joint content caching and transmission problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' reliability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of each user satisfies the instantaneous VR delay target. To address this problem, a distributed deep learning algorithm that brings together new neural network ideas from liquid state machine (LSM) and echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. The proposed algorithm enables each SBS to predict the users' reliability so as to find the optimal contents to cache and content transmission format for each cellular-connected UAV.

Spatial multiplexing (SM) at millimeter wave (mmWave) is an enabling technology introduced in IEEE 802.11ay to support high throughput applications. However, since IEEE 802.11ay commercial off-the-shelf devices are not yet available and the cost for implementation of mmWave testbeds is prohibitive, the expected SM performance in a real application is still unknown.

However, despite the remarkable advances in the field, AR/VR applications are mostly local and individual experiences. The main obstacle between current technology and future remote, multi-user AR/VR applications is the stringent end-to-end (E2E) latency requirement, which cannot exceed 20 ms to avoid motion sickness. Emerging AR/VR services put even more pressure on current network infrastructures, calling for considerable advancements toward fully cloud-native architectures. Cloud-based VR services, where participants can virtually interact across vast distances, remain a distant dream. Several challenges still arise concerning the deployment and management of VR services. This paper presents a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for the efficient orchestration of VR services in fog-cloud infrastructures. The model considers Fog Computing (FC), an extension of cloud computing, and Segment Routing (SR), which leverages the source routing paradigm.

Timestamped samples of the system state are recorded at instrumentation points at runtime. These are assembled into a graph, and edges between dependent samples recovered. This approach minimises the invasiveness of the instrumentation, while retaining high accuracy. We describe how our instrumentation can be implemented natively in common environments, how its output can be processed into a graph describing causality, and how heterogeneous data sources can be incorporated into this to maximise the scope of the profiling.

In addition to performance requirements, the latter computations impose soft real-time constraints, necessitating efficient, predictable parallel resource management. In this paper we propose a novel approach for increasing parallel system utilization while meeting application soft real-time deadlines. Our approach exploits the application tunability found in several general-purpose computations. Tunability refers to an application's ability to trade off resource requirements over time, while maintaining a desired level of output quality. We first describe language extensions to support tunability in the Calypso system, then characterize the performance benefits of tunability, using a synthetic task system to systematically identify its benefits. Our results show that application tunability is convenient to express and can significantly improve parallel system utilization for computations with predictability requirements.","","0-7695-0143-5","10.1109/IPPS.1999.760560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=760560","","Resource management;Parallel processing;Image recognition;Real time systems;Costs;Concurrent computing;Delay;Availability;Virtual reality;Hardware","real-time systems;resource allocation;parallel processing","application tunability;efficient parallel resource management;predictable parallel resource management;parallel computing;high-performance cluster platforms;SMP platforms;parallelism;image recognition;virtual reality;media processing;performance requirements;soft real-time constraints;parallel system utilization;application soft real-time deadlines;general-purpose computations;resource requirements trade-off;output quality;language extensions;Calypso system;synthetic task system","","4","","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quality of experience (QoE) depends on the combined effect of tile prediction and consumed resources. Recently, it has been found that with the field of view (FoV) and eye movement data collected for a user, one can infer the identity and preference of the user. Existing works investigate the privacy protection for eye movement, but never address how to protect the privacy in terms of FoV and how the privacy protection affects the QoE. In this paper, we strive to characterize and satisfy the FoV privacy requirement. We consider ""trading resources for privacy"". We first add camouflaged tile requests around the actual FoV and define spatial degree of privacy (SDoP) as a normalized number of camouflaged tile requests. By consuming more resources to ensure SDoP, the actual FoVs can be hidden. Then, we proceed to analyze the impacts of SDoP on the QoE by jointly optimizing the durations for prediction, computing, and transmission that maximizes the QoE given arbitrary predictor, configured resources, and SDoP. We find that a larger SDoP requires more resources but degrades the performance of tile prediction. Simulation with state-of-the-art predictors on a real dataset verifies the analysis and shows that a user requiring a larger SDoP can be served with better QoE.","1558-2612","978-1-6654-4266-4","10.1109/WCNC51071.2022.9771832","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9771832","privacy-aware VR;proactive VR;FoV privacy protection;spatial degree of privacy;VR federated learning","Privacy;Analytical models;Solid modeling;Data privacy;Conferences;Computational modeling;Virtual reality","data privacy;video streaming;virtual reality;visual databases","FoV privacy-aware VR streaming;proactive tile-based virtual reality video streaming;eye movement;future requested tiles;predicted tiles;QoE;tile prediction;consumed resources;view;privacy protection;FoV privacy requirement;camouflaged tile requests;actual FoV;configured resources;larger SDoP","","","","19","IEEE","16 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various solutions have been proposed including adaptive streaming methods for VR videos. However, the high bandwidth requirement of VR videos brings new challenges in designing proper adaptive streaming methods with respect to VR characteristics in terms of both coding and transmission. Streaming VR videos differ from traditional 2D videos as their users' perceptual Quality of Experience (QoE) is more sensitive to video stalls, quality variations, and as a matter of novelty, viewport dependent. The viewport movement is associated with new issues in adaptive streaming scheme design. In order to adapt to the fast viewport movement and restrict time constraints in VR videos, a tile-based VR video format adjustment is adopted in our research. In this paper, we present Q360AS, a novel adaptive streaming method for 360° VR videos that aims at maximizing the overall QoE during the transmission in environments with varying network conditions.

Some research projects have already tackled the problem of visually identifying hazards zones within virtual environments. Other approaches deal with the formal analysis of safety issues in expert systems for conformity checks. What is still missing is the bridge between visual representation and documentation. The virtual reality (VR) approaches do not support storage and processing of identified hazards, furthermore 3D models have to be prepared and converted to VR formats, which does not allow “online” analysis. Expert systems only cover an abstract, textual definition of hazard zones, which separates the safety domain from design.

Yin","Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Network, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA; Beijing Laboratory of Advanced Information Network, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","2018 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","30 Jul 2018","2018","","","1","6","In this paper, the problem of resource management is studied for a network of wireless virtual reality (VR) users communicating using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)- enabled LTE over unlicensed (LTE-U) network. In the studied model, {the UAVs act as VR control centers that collect tracking information from the VR users over the wireless uplink and, then, send the constructed VR images to the VR users over an LTE-U downlink.} Therefore, resource allocation in such a UAV-enabled LTE-U network must jointly consider the uplink and downlink links over both licensed and unlicensed bands. In such a VR setting, the UAVs can dynamically adjust the data size of each VR image by tuning its quality and format. By doing so, the UAVs can adjust the transmitted data size according to the spectrum allocated to each user so as to meet the delay requirement. Therefore, resource allocation must also take into account the image quality and format. This VR-centric resource allocation problem is formulated as a noncooperative game that enables a joint allocation of licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands, as well as a dynamic adaptation of VR image quality and format. To solve this game, a learning algorithm based on the machine learning tools of echo state networks (ESNs) with leaky integrator neurons is proposed. Unlike conventional ESN learning algorithms that are suitable for discrete-time systems, the proposed algorithm can dynamically adjust the update speed of the ESN's state and, hence, it can enable the UAVs to learn the continuous dynamics of their associated VR users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves up to 14% and 27.1% gains in terms of total VR QoE for all users compared to Q-learning using LTE-U and Q-learning using LTE.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-3180-5","10.1109/ICC.2018.8422503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8422503","","Downlink;Wireless communication;Resource management;Wireless fidelity;Delays;Uplink;Heuristic algorithms","autonomous aerial vehicles;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;resource allocation;virtual reality","echo state learning;wireless virtual reality resource allocation;UAV-enabled LTE-U networks;resource management;unmanned aerial vehicle;VR control centers;wireless uplink;constructed VR images;LTE-U downlink;licensed bands;unlicensed bands;VR-centric resource allocation problem;licensed spectrum bands;unlicensed spectrum bands;machine learning tools;echo state networks;associated VR users;total VR QoE;Q-learning;tracking information;ESN learning algorithms;noncooperative game","","19","","18","IEEE","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the high-quality panoramic video requires high transmission rate, the previous 4G network can not satisfy its transmission bandwidth requirements. Now 5G network[1] has the characteristics of larger bandwidth and lower delay, which can well solve the limitations of VR transmission bandwidth, and can meet the transmitting bandwidth[2] requirement of 2GBit/s for 8K HD panoramic video. Make 8K high-quality VR panoramic video live possible. As one of the main technologies to realize VR virtual reality, 3D panoramic video has important research value for improving the splicing speed when generating 3D panoramic video. Based on the construction and research of 3D panoramic video splicing system, this paper uses camera array and optical flow algorithm to simulate “virtual camera” in each perspective, and finally generates 3D panoramic video frequency with full perspective continuous stereo effect through interpolation and rendering of pixels of “virtual image”. In this paper, a parallel acceleration method for computing optical flow is proposed. The iterative method of patch matching optical flow algorithm is changed by a jumping method, and the attenuation factor of search window is modified, so that the original algorithm is optimized and accelerated, so as to improve the speed of generating 3D panoramic video.

The actuator was tested for multilayered tissue simulation, which required rendering abrupt changes and large forces. The designed controller adjusted the actuator inputs based on their capabilities. The brake provided an average force level while the motor superimposed the finer details on this profile.

Unfortunately, producing perfect registration is often simply not possible. Our goal is to quantify the sensitivity of users to registration error in these systems, and identify acceptability thresholds at which users can no longer distinguish between the spatial positioning of virtual and real objects.

Due to the computational and real-time display update requirements of virtual reality interfaces, the complexity of organ and tissue surfaces which can be displayed is limited. In this paper, we present two new algorithms for the production of anatomic surface models containing a pre-specified number of polygons from patient- or subject-specific volumetric image data sets. The advantage of these algorithms is that they efficiently tile complex surfaces with a specified number of polygons selected to optimize the trade-off between surface detail and real-time display rates. Surface detail is preserved by extracting key shape features from the segmented objects, which adaptively constrains the model tilers. To illustrate the utility of these models, we present an overview of their application in computed endoscopy and surgery planning as developed in the Virtual Reality Assisted Surgery Program (VRASP) in the Biomedical Imaging Resource.","","0-8186-7867-4","10.1109/SMA.1997.634887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=634887","","Virtual reality;Biomedical imaging;Surgery;Medical control systems;Control systems;Data visualization;Computer displays;Computer interfaces;Production;Tiles","medical image processing;physiological models;virtual reality;surgery;data visualisation;real-time systems;feature extraction","shape-based algorithms;patient-specific anatomy;3D medical images;virtual endoscopy;virtual surgery;visualization process;virtual reality environments;real-time display update requirements;computational requirements;virtual reality interfaces;organ surfaces;tissue surfaces;anatomic surface models;polygons;volumetric image data sets;complex surface tiling;surface detail;key shape feature extraction;segmented objects;surgery planning;Virtual Reality Assisted Surgery Program;Biomedical Imaging Resource","","3","3","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modern information technologies enable various means for partially solving the mentioned issues by providing remote access, VR-technologies, digital twins, etc. The paper provides a brief overview of aspects related to introducing virtual labs into educational process, with the main focus on the requirement for the virtual hardware, such as an electric power drive system, should replicate processes with time resolution in order of several milliseconds. And the interaction of the equipment with the student should be done in a way there is a feeling of a real object, necessitating low response time in order of hundreds of milliseconds. This requires high priority of computational power allocation for mathematical model calculation as well as high communication channel bandwidth between the computation power source and the user interface. The paper presents an example of such a server deployed virtual laboratory. The functionality was inspired by that of real equipment installed at Energy saving electric power drive laboratory at the Department of Electric Drives of Moscow Power Engineering Institute.

As AV applications are designed to create experiences for real users, it is also desired to bare in mind their subjective feedback. Thus, in this work we compare segmentation methods from a perceptual point of view, by conducting subjective experiments with a group of users.

To meet these conflicting requirements with limited radio resources, edge intelligence is a promising architecture. It exploits the edge server co-located at the base station to predict the field of view (FoV) of the next VR video segment, pre-render the three-dimensional video within the predicted FoV, and transmit it to the user in advance. Since the prediction is not error-free, the predicted FoV may not cover the actual FoV requested by the user, and hence may result in video quality loss. To address this issue, we first formulate a constrained partially observable Markov decision process problem to optimize the redundant range of the FoV according to the head motion prediction and the redundant range for the previous video segment. Then, we develop a constrained deep reinforcement learning algorithm to minimize the video quality loss ratio subject to the latency constraint. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of video quality loss ratio (from 6.9% to 4.9%) and latency (from 0.72 s to 0.63 s).","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685224","China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685224","Virtual reality;wireless video streaming;low-latency communications;partially observable Markov decision process;constrained deep reinforcement learning","Wireless communication;Simulation;Redundancy;Reinforcement learning;Streaming media;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;video streaming;virtual reality","actual FoV;constrained partially observable Markov decision process problem;redundant range;head motion prediction;previous video segment;constrained deep reinforcement learning algorithm;video quality loss ratio subject;latency constraint;VR video streaming;wireless virtual reality systems;immersive experiences;high data rate;conflicting requirements;radio resources;edge intelligence;edge server co-located;base station;VR video segment;pre-render;three-dimensional video;predicted FoV;error-free;time 0.63 s to 0.72 s","","","","22","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Virtualization poses unique software defects which must be detected and prevented specific software requirements designed for virtualization environments. In this research thesis, software virtualization technology became used to transparently record the allocation and release of memory resources implemented to a database connection on a virtual machine in the cloud, and these records provided the information to detect memory leaks hiding in the code. Memory leaks account for lack of a self-adaptive handy cloud computing structure due to consistent use ordinary static and dynamic memory leak analysis tools. Most of the available tools for defects detection do not provide for consistency of memory leak prevention. The main intention of the research developed a self-adaptive virtualization model for software defects detection and prevention of software Memory Leaks Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning Methods. Data sampling used was code-based sampling based on Low-Density Parity Checks which avoided overestimating false positives for the variables used. There were a total population of 35 variables for the study, out of these; seven variables were selected as a sample. The sample objects, classes and class loaders access for the 4-database test connection used a minimum 0.1% sampling rate which had 4 database connection references out of every 7 variables used.

Untethered mobile devices are the main players for watching 360-degree content, thereby the precision of predicting the future viewpoints is one key challenge to improve the quality of the playbacks. In this paper, we investigate the image features of the 360-degree videos and the contextual information of the viewpoint trajectories. Specifically, we design ladder convolution to adapt for the distorted image, and propose LadderNet to transfer the knowledge from the pre-trained model and retrieve the features from the distorted image.

By integrating the concept of digital twin, we developed a 3D platform where users have the perception that they are exhibiting the actual library. To do so, we conducted a perceptual study to understand the current usage of physical libraries, examine the users' experience in VR, and identify the requirements and expectations in the development of a virtual library counterpart.

To this end, this article develops a household fitness motion evaluation system based on ToF camera with a mobile phone. The system firstly uses the ToF camera to collect the 3D human body point cloud information. Then Huawei augmented reality engine is employed to track the human skeleton. As all the spatial coordinates of joints are acquired, virtual human model can be reconstructed remotely on the phone. The mobile phone, working as the edge node between the person and the cloud server, transmits the captured human motion model parameters to the cloud platform. Then a hierarchical co-occurrence neural network recognizes and scores the detected user actions online. The experimental results show that the system proposed in this paper is portable and inexpensive.

The main focus is on gestures, which are related to skill, performance, or physical emotion (not facial) e.g. sports, martial arts, playing instruments, acting, etc. The initial idea behind this design is to provide a virtual practice environment mainly for actors in order to learn new gestures or moves. However, this virtual environment can also be used by many other target audiences based on their needs. Sometimes, ambiguity is part of knowledge transfer and becomes more salient or critical when it comes to tacit knowledge, especially at early stages of transfer. Performance while maintaining believable gesture is a must have requirement for actors. Visual references (mainly video in absence of trainer) are commonly used by actors in order to learn specific moves or gestures. However, videos are limited to 2D screen view (even if stereoscopic or 360°) and do not provide chance of studying a freezing moment from all angles, simultaneously. Although this can be partly mimicked using multi-camera rig, it is still limited to the number of shots taken and only provides a linear frame sequence (mostly used as VFX). Immersive virtual environments not only eliminate this limitation but also provide one to one scale experience. In this study, the process of creating such environment is discussed in detail. This includes planning, concept design, selecting tools, establishing the environment, properly selecting or creating the virtual character(s), capturing the motion or using existing ones from different Mocap libraries, actor's interaction with VR equipment, user experience, etc. In addition to studying reference moves and gestures (frame by frame and from any angle), the user is able to observe his/her performance in VR. This can be achieved using motion capture cameras installed at the practice location. The captured content is later assigned to the user's virtual representative i.e. a 3d character created based on his/her physical body features for side by side analysis with the reference. This provides countless interaction possibilities that cannot be achieved in the real world. Few examples are: multiplying the reference character and freeze two or more different moments (frames) and create a walkthrough, creating an immersive timeline based on the actor's progress (also requires multiplying), assigning reference moves to the user's avatar to be compared with his/her movements by himself/herself or anyone else (different from side by side comparison with the reference character), and many others. What has been discussed above is fully illustrated and described in this paper including detailed figures. The contribution of this study can be extended to various fields from acting and sport to stop motion and creative art, as the processes presented in the paper are designed in the most affordable way, using hardware and software currently available to basic users.","2474-1485","978-1-5386-4494-2","10.1109/VSMM.2017.8346255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8346255","immersive virtual environments;immersive virtual reality;tacit knowledge transfer;gesture;virtual reality;mocap;learning in virtual reality;htc vive;oculus rift;unity;steam vr","Teleportation;Knowledge transfer;Observers;Virtual environments;Art;Tools;Three-dimensional displays","gesture recognition;virtual reality","reference character;reference moves;immersive virtual environments;tacit knowledge transfer;virtual practice environment;believable gesture;virtual character;virtual representative","","1","","10","IEEE","26 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we propose a novel application- and reliability-aware SFC embedding algorithm aiming to (a) decrease the latency and (b) increase the reliability of ULLRA. In this regard, we prioritize ULLRA as high priority SFC requests and reserve an amount of physical resources (bandwidth, memory, CPU) for embedding only high priority SFC requests to improve their latency and reliability. We formulate our proposed algorithm in the form of an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization model to obtain optimal results. We also offer a heuristic algorithm to obtain near optimal results to reduce the execution time and make it usable for real-world networks. We consider constraints on maximum tolerable end-to-end delay, physical resource utilization (bandwidth, memory, CPU), and reliability. We examine our proposed SFC embedding algorithm in different test scenarios such as changing the number and the length of SFC requests, the proportion of reserved physical resources for high priority SFC requests, and the proportion of low-latency traffic flows to the total traffic flows. The results show that our proposed algorithms effectively improve the latency and reliability of ULLRA with minimal side effects on other applications compared to state of the art algorithms.","","978-1-6654-3983-1","10.1109/NFV-SDN53031.2021.9665118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9665118","service function chaining (SFC);network function virtualization (NFV);software defined network (SDN);reliability;quality of service (QoS);virtual network function (VNF).","Service function chaining;Software algorithms;Memory management;Bandwidth;Software reliability;Network function virtualization;Internet of Things","computer network reliability;integer programming;linear programming;telecommunication traffic","NFV-enabled network;line networks;diverse service requirements;ULLRA;augmented reality;virtual reality;IoT applications;network function virtualization;software defined networking;complementary solutions;reliability-aware SFC embedding algorithm;high priority SFC requests;integer linear programming optimization model;heuristic algorithm;maximum tolerable end-to-end delay;physical resource utilization;reserved physical resources;ultralow-latency and reliable applications;low-latency traffic applications;reliability-aware service function chaining embedding algorithm;Internet of Things;SDN;5G;6G","","4","","15","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To explore the benefit of broadcasting user-correlated decode-dependent video resources to spatially correlated VR users, the network should dynamically cluster APs into virtual cells for a different group of VR users with overlapped video requests. We first introduce the conventional non-learning-based association algorithms. We then formulate the association problem into a networked-distributed Partially Observable Markov decision process (ND-POMDP). To solve it, we propose a multi-agent deep DRL algorithm based on the rainbow agent with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate decisions from observation. Our simulation results shown that our CF-MB network can effectively handle real-time video transmission from UAVs to VR users.

Such point clouds consist of a large amount of 3D coordinates, which describe a scene or object in 3D space by its geometry and texture attributes. Moreover, they are an effective representation of 3D environments for applications such as Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality. One of the main problems for such data is that the number of points is typically too large to allow for real-time transmission or efficient storage. Thus, compressing such 3D data is a key issue to reduce the amount of required bandwidth or memory. This paper presents a method for efficient compression of dynamic point cloud data within the current MPEG standardization framework for dynamic point cloud compression. The key benefit of the presented work is the reduced number of encoded and decoded 3D points compared to the reference framework, thus encoding and decoding complexity is reduced significantly. Objective results show a speed-up of around 35-40% in coding times. Furthermore, reconstruction quality is preserved, thus reducing bit rate requirements by up to 30%.

Moreover, to capture the accurate users’ interaction behaviors, it is critical to jointly predict the motions of users with spatially close proximity in VR. Accordingly, we formulate a new problem, named Group Motion Prediction for Social VR problem (GMSV), with group consistency requirement and the objective of prediction costs minimization on the MEC server. Then, we prove that GMSV is NP-Hard and design a new algorithm, named Social-Aware Latency Synchronization for Remote Users (SLSR), to select an appropriate set of remote users in social VR for motion prediction, with the ideas of generating a partial order set of remote subgroups and extracting the remote subgroups with high social interaction utilities.

The effects of uniform latency degradation based on mean or worst-case values are well researched. In contrast, the effects of latency jitter, the distribution pattern of latency changes over time has largely been ignored so far, although today's consumer VR systems are extremely vulnerable in this respect.In this paper, we propose to create a model of latency and latency jitter with empirical distributions as well as a method of using those models to inject latency.

Traditional simulation based on DELMIA platform has some shortcomings, such as limited capability of detailed observation, low precision and time-consuming. VR system simulation can effectively solve these problems. However, in engineering applications, the large model simulation in VR system cannot meet the real-time requirements, and collision detection is often slow or even collapsed. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a dual-model approach for engineering collision detection in the CAVE environment: a display model and a collision detection model are established respectively. The display model contains a large model, and the collision detection model contains a manikin and the hidden large model. For visual rendering, the display model uses caching strategy, and the collision detection model uses real-time strategy. The two sets of models are combined and presented in CAVE. Because the dual-model approach separates the visual rendering of the large model from the collision detection calculation, the large model in the collision detection model can be lightweight, or the area of interest can be selected for the collision detection calculation. Experiments show that the dual-model approach can effectively guarantee the real-time performance of visual display and collision detection, and provides a complete solution for engineering collision detection using the CAVE system, which can be applied in the fields of industrial virtual maintenance, assembly, and pre-design evaluation.","","978-1-7281-4765-9","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2019.00-24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8951931","CAVE;dual-model;collision detection;virtual reality","Collision avoidance;Solid modeling;Real-time systems;Rendering (computer graphics);Visualization;Computational modeling;Load modeling","rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","dual-model approach;engineering collision detection;display model;CAVE environment;virtual simulation;DELMIA platform;VR system simulation;visual rendering","","","","10","IEEE","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve this problem, we take photographs around the object in a constant angle interval. After this, the object movie system is constructed in a manner of viewpoint synthesis from originally captured images. To further reduce the data requirements of the object movie, we propose a method to retain effective regions in each captured image. Only the retained regions are used to synthesize the resulting virtual views. Experiments show that our algorithm can synthesize virtual views better and faster than previous methods.

However, research provides limited evidence for effective transfer of benefits from computerized cognitive training to real-life functions. Virtual reality (VR) exergames using motion-interaction offer a more realistic and natural training environment, and are therefore expected to facilitate a more effective transfer. Although commercial exergames may bring about some cognitive gains, they usually do not target cognitive functions directly. Here we describe a novel exergames platform, the Active Brain Trainer (ABT), designed to directly target EF, using games in multiple realistic contexts. The software adapts in real-time to the patient's behavior, providing feedback and rewards, and hence may enhance usability and compliance. The primary goal of the current study is to assess the feasibly and acceptability of this platform for community-dwelling ABI patients during the chronic phase. A secondary goal is to assess the initial efficacy on EF and functional benefits from program training. Participants were instructed to use the games for 15-20 sessions. Neuropsychological assessments of EF and daily life functions were performed before and after training. Participants also filled a satisfaction questionnaire following training. All training and assessments were conducted in the participants' homes. Game performance was recorded throughout training sessions. Preliminary results from the six ABI patients who successfully completed the program so far show no adverse effects. Participants reported enjoyment and satisfaction from training. Participants performed increasingly more challenging EF tasks within game environments. Initial results show improvements in functional tasks and most executive neuropsychological assessments following training. Additional participants are currently being trained to increase the power of the results. These preliminary findings support the feasibility and potential efficacy of the motion-based cognitive training of EF for community-dwelling individuals with ABI.","2331-9569","978-1-5090-3053-8","10.1109/ICVR.2017.8007530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8007530","cognitive training;exergames;motion-based;acquired brain injury;community-dwelling;executive functions","Games;Training;Avatars;Radiation detectors;Brain injuries;Medical treatment;Atmospheric measurements","brain;cognition;computer games;injuries;medical computing;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","motion-based virtual reality cognitive training;executive functions;acquired brain injury community-dwelling individuals;ABI;long-term cognitive disability;rehabilitation facility;therapy sessions;mobility requirement;home environment;computerized cognitive training;VR exergames;motion interaction;active brain trainer;ABT;chronic phase;neuropsychological assessments;daily life functions;game environments;functional tasks","","5","","69","IEEE","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The only requirement is the ability to track across frames at least four feature points that are specified by the user during system initialization and whose world coordinates are unknown. The resulting system allows a user to ""augment"" a real 3D environment with computer-generated objects by interactively manipulating one or more images of that environment.","","0-8186-8283-3","10.1109/CVVRHC.1998.660372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=660372","","Electrical capacitance tomography;Cameras;Augmented reality;Graphics;Calibration;Computer science;Application software;Surgery;Power system planning;User interfaces","virtual reality;image processing","interactive image;video manipulation;altering reality;augmented reality;system initialization;world coordinates;image-based approach","","1","","26","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper proposes a fast and easy off-line calibration strategy based on well-established camera calibration methods. Our method does not need exhausting effort on the collection of world-to-image correspondence data. All the correspondence data are sampled with an image based method and they are able to achieve sub-pixel accuracy. The method is applicable for all AR systems based on optical see-through head-mounted display (HMD), though we took a head-mounted projective display (HMPD) as the example. We first review the calibration requirements for an augmented reality system and the existing calibration methods. Then a new view projection model for optical see through HMD is addressed in detail, and proposed calibration method and experimental result are presented. Finally, the evaluation experiments and error analysis are also included. The evaluation results show that our calibration method is fairly accurate and consistent.","1087-8270","0-7695-1882-6","10.1109/VR.2003.1191121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191121","","Calibration;Augmented reality;Virtual reality","augmented reality;image registration;calibration;image sampling;helmet mounted displays","head-mounted projective display calibration;augmented reality systems;computer generated virtual images;virtual worlds;real worlds;virtual object registration;projection information;viewing device;offline calibration strategy;camera calibration methods;world-to-image correspondence data;image based method;sub-pixel accuracy;AR systems;optical see-through head-mounted display;HMD;head-mounted projective display;HMPD;calibration requirements;view projection model;error analysis","","3","3","29","IEEE","2 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The pronunciation level is scored by comparing the similarity between learner and standard's audio and video speech signals separately. The final score of the learner's pronunciation is gotten by fusing the above scores with the linear weighting combination approach. Referring to the knowledge that the visual speech can aid the audio to improve the human perception especially under noisy environments, the paper proposes a noise adaptive weighting strategy in fusing process. To solve the problem of disagreement of speech length due to the various speaking speed, the paper adopts the dynamic warping algorithm to do the time alignment between the test speeches and the standard ones. The data selected from the Australia audio and visual speech corpus (AVOZES) is employed to test the performance of our automatic evaluating system. The experiment result shows that audio and visual speech fusion approach improves the rationality of automatic pronunciation accessing system by making full use of correlative and complementary information between acoustic and visual speech comparing to the audio-speech-only evaluation results.","","978-89-94364-22-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6530528","bimodal fusion;timing alignment;pronunciation evaluation;visual speech","","audio signal processing;computer aided instruction;sensor fusion;speech processing;video signal processing;virtual reality","pronunciation quality evaluation approach;noise adaptive weight;virtual pedagogy application;English learner;automatic assessment method;bimodal fusion decision algorithm;audio speech signal;video speech signal;linear weighting combination approach;visual speech;human perception;Australia audio and visual speech corpus;AVOZES;acoustic speech","","","","9","","13 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this, we present an integrated design methodology for AR spaces, that incorporates both tracking and human factors into the design process. On the tracking side, we develop the first VI-SLAM evaluation technique that combines the flexibility and control of virtual environments with real inertial data. We use it to perform systematic, quantitative experiments on the effect of visual texture on pose estimation accuracy; through 2000 trials in 20 environments, we reveal the impact of both texture complexity and edge strength. On the human side, we show how virtual reality (VR) can be used to evaluate user satisfaction with environments, and highlight how this can be tailored to AR research and use cases.

In this work, we consider the key challenges for broadcasting such content to a large number of audience thereby enabling new disruptions in mass media consumption. The technology potential and practical constraints for such deployments were also evaluated using realistic network settings. Based on the performance evaluations, it was shown that with slightly higher system bandwidth requirements, VR broadcast can be supported under ideal conditions, using 5G millimeter wave small cell networks. Potential areas for future work in order to make VR broadcast a reality is also discussed.","","978-1-5386-1154-8","10.1109/WCNCW.2018.8368976","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8368976","","5G mobile communication;Bandwidth;Interference;Conferences;Wireless communication;Long Term Evolution","5G mobile communication;broadcast communication;cellular radio;smart phones;virtual reality","wireless virtual reality applications;mass media consumption;VR broadcast;5G millimeter wave small cell networks;cell network;smartphones;social media experiences;mobile networks;reliability;virtual reality broadcasting;fifth generation network;5G network","","17","","17","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The depression plays an important role in R&D management. With a growing sense of crisis during the depression, laboratories are reorganized and R&D targets are refreshed. Moreover, the depression causes the change of social requirements. Then, an economic boom occurs in the midst or the latter half of the cycle. New laboratories are established.

Although CT scans allow accurate extraction of bones and the skin surface, muscles appear as poorly contrasted structures. The challenge is, thus, to produce an intuitive modelling tool that will support interactive deformation of a generic atlas model into a patient-specific model. For this, we first generate synthetic scans along pre-defined slicing axes in patient space. Muscle outlines obtained by an initial mapping of generic atlas models are then superimposed on these slices. These outlines are deformed by simple geometric operations to match the underlying muscle shapes using a novel software tool, the Muscle Modelling Laboratory (MML).

In assembly process, dynamic disturbances such as advance delivery and changes in processing time may occur, which requires rescheduling of robotic assembly line (RAL). Traditional scheduling methods are not sufficient to meet the real-time and adaptive requirements. Due to digital twin’s characteristics of virtual reality interaction, real-time mapping and iterative optimization, the digital twin-based assembly planning (DTAP) model is established and the task rescheduling strategy for RAL is proposed. The virtual RAL is the real reflection of the physical RAL. When the RAL is dynamically disturbed, based on the virtual entity of RAL and the adaptive discrete bees algorithm (ADBA), the assembly task assignment is optimized and fed back to the physical RAL. Mapping and interaction between the physical and virtual RAL achieves the precise scheduling and execution of assembly tasks and improves the assembly efficiency. Finally, the case study based on bearing fitting is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","978-1-6654-0527-0","10.1109/CSCWD54268.2022.9776253","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9776253","robotic assembly line;assembly planning;dynamic task rescheduling;digital twin","Robotic assembly;Solid modeling;Job shop scheduling;Production;Virtual reality;Real-time systems;Reflection","assembly planning;cost reduction;optimisation;production engineering computing;robotic assembly;scheduling;virtual reality","digital twin-based task rescheduling;robotic assembly line;robotic assembly technology;automatic production line;production efficiency;product quality;dynamic disturbances;processing time;adaptive requirements;virtual reality interaction;real-time mapping;iterative optimization;digital twin-based assembly planning model;task rescheduling strategy;virtual RAL;physical RAL;assembly task assignment;assembly efficiency;smart manufacturing;adaptive discrete bees algorithm;ADBA","","","","22","IEEE","20 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The final goal should be to provide the apparatus to various categories of drivers - eg. truck drivers, disables, young and old peoples, etc - in order to expand the data bases of accidents for road safety, to use it as a teaching tool and a driving ability test. Starting from the analysis of human motion perception and from vehicle dynamics, the synthesis of the simulator has been completed. The systempsilas kinematics and dynamics are analytically described. The systempsilas performances have been analyzed by simulation and the actions transmitted to the driver have been compared with those estimated by means of the multi-body model of the vehicle riding on a selected path. The kinematics of the seat of the driving simulator can be quite different from the kinematics of the car seat: in fact only the actions that can be sensed by the driver need to be approximately reproduced and not necessarily the kinematics.

A tele-operative robotic catheter master system was designed for vascular interventional surgery, to reduce radiation-exposure times, and afford unskilled surgeons the opportunity to learn basic catheter/guidewire skills, while allowing experienced physicians to perform surgeries cooperatively. This paper focuses on the requirements, design and prototyping of the haptic device and the translational and rotational measurement part dedicated to catheters. Two cameras are used to track the translational and rotational displacements of the catheter in real time for the contactless measurement and four permanent magnets and coils are applied to generate the Ampere force in order to realize the haptic feedback. During the training process, novice doctors can drive the real catheter directly and carry out the intervention with haptic interfaces with force feedback, which provides the surgeon with a sense of touch.

Through objective measures of teleoperation performance and subjective questionnaires, we found that operators performed worse using the FPV interface and had higher perceived levels of cognitive load when compared to traditional interface design. Additional analysis of physiological measures highlighted that objective stress levels and cognitive load were also influenced by task duration and perceived performance, providing an insight into what interfaces could target to support teleoperator requirements during aerial manipulation tasks.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-7927-1","10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981656","EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/R009953/1,EP/L016230/1,EP/R026173/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9981656","Virtual reality and interfaces;telerobotics and teleoperation;human-centered robotics","Training;Measurement;Virtual reality;Forestry;Cognitive load;Physiology;Task analysis","aerospace control;autonomous aerial vehicles;cognition;forestry;manipulators;telerobotics;user interfaces;virtual reality","aerial manipulation tasks;aerial physical interaction tasks;demanding aerial manipulation task;FPV interface;immersive FPV teleoperation;immersive view;low-cost available drone systems;recent momentum;reliable control;task duration;teleoperated aerial manipulation;teleoperation performance;teleoperator requirements;traditional interface design;Unity-based interface;virtual reality interfaces","","1","","40","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are monocular depth estimation methods that address this requirement by using neural network models to predict depth values for each pixel. However, as this is a quickly moving field and the state-of-the-art is constantly evolving, how do we choose the best depth estimation model for 3D content creation for VR? It can be difficult to interpret the widely used benchmark metrics and how they relate to the quality of the created 3D/VR content.In this paper, we explore a user-centred approach to evaluating depth estimation models with regard to 3D content creation. We look at evaluating these models based on content created with these models that an end-user might see, rather than just their immediate output (depth maps) that does not directly contribute to users’ perceptual experience. In particular, we investigate the relationship between commonly used depth estimation metrics, image similarity metrics applied to synthesised novel viewpoints, and user perception of quality and similarity of these novel view-points. Our results suggest that the standard depth estimation metrics are indeed good indicators of 3D quality, and that they correspond well with human judgements and image similarity metrics on novel viewpoints synthesised from a range of sources of depth data. We also show that users rate a state-of-the-art depth estimation model as almost visually indistinguishable from the outputs derived from ground truth sensor data.","2151-2205","978-1-6654-0645-1","10.1109/IVCNZ54163.2021.9653344","Mars; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9653344","","Measurement;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Estimation;Virtual reality;Benchmark testing;Quality assessment","neural nets;stereo image processing;video signal processing;virtual reality","user perception;image similarity metrics;VR content creation;user perspective;monocular images;neural network;user-centred approach;depth maps;depth estimation metrics;monocular depth estimation;monocular videos;virtual reality;3D content creation;3D quality","","","","18","IEEE","29 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the wide availability of realistic computer graphics in our day-to-day life, our eyes get spoiled by stunning computer generated virtual worlds nowadays; thus, the acceptance of these applications depends more and more on the realistic, state-of-the-art rendering of the virtual environment, as well as the convenient usage. While edutainment applications and models are specifically built to fulfill these requirements, the data, models and system structures of current VR simulation system in scientific domains usually are not. They are pure expert systems that demand for specific expertise in order to use them or understand the simulation results.

In this paper we discuss the requirements for different quality levels of virtual reality and the feasibility of providing these in 4G and 5G cellular networks. In particular, we show how reduced latency can reduce the bit rate requirements and enable photo realistic XR over mobile networks.","2378-4873","978-1-5386-6151-2","10.1109/CAMAD.2018.8514957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514957","virtual reality;augmented reality;mobile edge computing;radio access","Streaming media;Rendering (computer graphics);Servers;Bit rate;Tracking","4G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;cellular radio;cloud computing;mobile computing;virtual reality","5G cellular networks;bit rate requirements;photo realistic XR;mobile networks;high quality mobile XR;mixed reality;user device;edge server;virtual reality;quality levels;4G cellular networks;edge cloud servers;augmented reality","","2","","16","IEEE","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The frontloading of virtual integration, testing, and validation of critical performance metrics (e.g., range, power, and acceleration) necessitates fast and accurate plant models for system-level studies. As the design evolves from concepts to final validation, these models should be updated synchronously. This work explores advantages offered by virtualization of validation by applying simulation models developed through traditional design workflows. The use case considered for the work is the range prediction of the electric vehicle for a given state of the battery capacity. The plant model of the electric powertrain will be developed in a system simulation environment for monitoring battery capacity degradation and its multidisciplinary performance over the usage history.

Trilateration, triangulation, and multilateration are three widely-used techniques for localization depending on the available information. The main drawbacks of these methods are the requirements of a large number of anchors and an elaborately designed layout. To accomplish the localization task with minimal resources while maintaining reasonable accuracy, we propose a 3-D source localization method with a compact infrastructure (prototype realized with 4 anchors located within an area of 2.5×20 cm2) by utilizing only phase-difference information. The proposed method first estimates the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the target and then finds the candidate 3-D location along on the DOA by minimizing a cost function. This system is compared to the other two similar setups based on simulations and the experimental tests are carried out using acoustic waves. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve 3-D location error of 2.77 cm for a target at 0.5 m without synchronization between the transmitter and the receivers. The relatively small system size and sufficient location accuracy provide possibilities in controller tracking for virtual reality applications.","2076-1465","978-9-0827-9705-3","10.23919/Eusipco47968.2020.9287378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9287378","","Solid modeling;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Transmitters;Receivers;Virtual reality;Synchronization;Task analysis","direction-of-arrival estimation;radio direction-finding;virtual reality;wireless sensor networks","phase-difference-based 3-D;source localization;compact receiver configuration;localization depending;elaborately designed layout;localization task;compact infrastructure;phase-difference information;candidate 3-D location;3-D location error","","","","18","","18 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By processing applications’ data closer to the users, service providers are able to offload origin servers and their underlying network infrastructure, which consequently reduces users’ experienced latency. In this paper, we consider internet-based applications with strict latency tolerance which are primarily enabled by the MEC architecture, e.g., Virtual Reality (VR) control systems, cloud gaming, and smart healthcare. Moreover, nodes at the edge may host application-related tasks as well as assist in their provision. We introduce the Task Distribution (TD) problem, where the objective is to maximize the overall Quality of Service (QoS) while ensuring that tasks’ latency requirements are satisfied. The TD problem is modeled as an Integer Programming problem, taking into account three components: (i) tasks’ priority assignment, (ii) placement and (iii) routing through the MEC network. We propose to approach the TD problem through an approximation scheme, called Shortest-Flow Approximation (SFA), which considers pre-determined network flows selected according to a Betweenness-based criterion. In our experiments, we first extract useful insights on the TD problem that help characterize its solution. Then, we evaluate SFA’s performance empirically across different experimental settings, showing numerical results confirming its proximity to the optimal solution.","2771-5663","978-1-6654-8627-9","10.1109/CloudNet55617.2022.9978788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9978788","Edge Computing;Resource Allocation;Quality of Service;Operations Research;Combinatorial Optimization","Integer programming;Solid modeling;Multi-access edge computing;Quality of service;Virtual reality;Medical services;Routing","cloud computing;file servers;integer programming;Internet;quality of service;virtual reality","application-related tasks;applications;Betweenness-based criterion;called Shortest-Flow Approximation;cloud gaming;Integer Programming problem;MEC network;mobile networks;MultiAccess Edge Computing paradigm;multiAccess Edge Computing systems;origin servers;pre-determined network;service providers;smart healthcare;strict latency tolerance;Task Distribution problem;TD problem;underlying network infrastructure;users;Virtual Reality control systems","","","","36","IEEE","16 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The material begins with an analysis of the content of the concept of a digital twin. Existing definitions and usage examples are discussed. The analysis allows us to formulate the information gap problem that impedes the introduction of digital twin technology in the field of creating a number of complex electrical products, for example, electric aircraft engines. Modern methods of solving this problem are focused on increasing the information base of modeling by accumulating large amounts of data for subsequent processing using semantic technologies and artificial intelligence. Existing data integration methods for analyzing and predicting the evolution of complex technical objects are unrepresentative, expensive, and error-prone. We propose the justification of the sociophysical approach as a way of forming a reliable and consistently interpreted way of representing a complex electrical engineering object. The analysis allowed us to formulate the requirements for the mathematical model of the digital twin. It is shown that the sociophysical model of a technical object, formed within the framework of a multi-aspect sociophysical description meets the specified requirements. Based on this, it is concluded that the sociophysical model of EEO can be a prototype of the digital twin model, which can be used to form a life cycle management system for a EEO. The processes that occur in a system that includes a sociophysical object as an object of management have a different nature: electrical, technical, technological, economic, social, informational, etc. This allows you to analyze and, if necessary, optimize processes, both in virtual mode and online, throughout the entire lifecycle of the EEO. In particular, to optimize the structure of the designed object taking into account the features of the production and technological structure at a specific enterprise; to Refine the model based on operational data for monitoring the stages of the life cycle associated with the design, development and production, operation and, ultimately, conversion and disposal; to Refine the model of the designed object taking into account the features of each stage of the life cycle.","","978-1-7281-9116-4","10.1109/ICOECS50468.2020.9278481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9278481","digital twin;sociophysical approach;sociophysical object","Electric potential;Digital twin;Economics;Thermal energy;Production;Thermodynamics;Data models","artificial intelligence;data integration;electrical engineering computing;product design;product life cycle management;solid modelling;virtual reality","complex electrical products;data integration;complex technical objects;complex electrical engineering object;sociophysical model;technical object;digital twin technology;data processing;semantic technologies;artificial intelligence;EEO lifecycle;3D models;virtual design;virtual product","","","","30","IEEE","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are two different methods for colorization. The interaction-based colorization method can generate results based on user interaction. However, this method requires considerable artificial interaction to achieve the desired results. Another method is automatic colorization based on deep learning. However, in this case, the colorization result is unique and cannot be adjusted if the result is incorrect or if the user has additional requirements. In this paper, we combine deep learning with user interaction and propose a grayscale image colorization method based on generative adversarial networks. In this method, a full convolutional neural network is constructed based on the U-net structure as a generator that can process images of any size. The training data is automatically generated by randomly simulating the interactive strokes. The experimental results indicate that this approach can efficiently achieve good colorization results and is capable of generating results based on different user interactions.","2375-141X","978-1-7281-4752-9","10.1109/ICVRV47840.2019.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212835","Computing methodologies;Artificial intelligence;Computer vision;Image representations","Gray-scale;Image color analysis;Training;Color;Generators;Neural networks;Generative adversarial networks","convolutional neural nets;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence)","training data;interactive strokes;convolutional neural network;grayscale image colorization method;deep learning;automatic colorization;artificial interaction;user interaction;interaction-based colorization method;classical image editing problem;generative adversarial networks;interactive grayscale image colorization","","","","0","IEEE","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aptitude of the proposed HUD interface lies within the driver's focusing ability to the HUD interface and the actual traffic. This paper analyses the performance behaviour through user-tests using different focal levels for the projection of a full-windshield HUD interface. For this purpose, a VR driving simulator has been developed to test the different depths of field configurations of a HUD while driving in various weather and traffic conditions with and without the HUD.

Here the term cross-platform refers to two of the most popular operating systems: Windows and Linux. Currently available free-for-noncommercial-use software development kits (SDKs) deal with a single haptic interaction point (HIP), i.e. the tip of the haptic probe. However, many applications as path planning, virtual assembly, medical or dental simulations, as well as scientific exploration require object-object interactions, meaning any part of the complex 3D object attached to the probe collides with the other objects in the virtual scene. Collision detections and penetration depths between 3D objects must be quickly computed to generate forces to be displayed by the haptic device. In these circumstances, implementation of haptic applications is very challenging when the numbers, stiffness and/or complexity of objects in the scene are considerable, mainly because of high update rates needed to avoid instabilities of the system. The proposed framework meets this high requirement and provides a high-performance test bed for further research in algorithms for collision detection and generation of haptic forces.","","0-7695-2112-6","10.1109/HAPTIC.2004.1287207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1287207","","Haptic interfaces;Application software;Probes;Layout;Software libraries;Virtual reality;Imaging phantoms;Operating systems;Linux;Programming","haptic interfaces;virtual reality;Unix;collision avoidance;rendering (computer graphics);software libraries","haptic virtual reality;PHANToM;haptic device;cross-platform haptic;Windows;Linux;software development kits;haptic interaction point;haptic probe;path planning;virtual assembly;medical simulations;dental simulations;scientific exploration;object-object interactions;collision detections;penetration depths;haptic applications;high-performance test;haptic forces;freely-available libraries;operating systems","","4","3","19","IEEE","19 Apr 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When segmenting the edge of the remote sensing image water area, there will be problems such as various types of surface water area and complex and changeable water area texture structure. Therefore, there are higher requirements for the accuracy of segmentation in the simulation process.

Problem-solving starts in preschool by observing and modelling adults' behaviour to face situations and come up with solutions (vicarious learning). Hence, children can understand how their actions affect problems and their outcomes. Like in other in-developing countries, children grew along with technology in Chile, although students receive programming classes in secondary school. Nowadays, with high-level block-based programming languages, developing programming competencies in children seems a reachable task for enhancing problem-solving competencies. Nonetheless, children do not develop programming and electronics competencies because these technology competencies usually appear at high-education levels. Moreover, primary school teachers usually can avoid developing those competencies because they seem outside the knowledge that students must develop. Nowadays, we can use Arduino to improve the development of problem-solving and computing programming competencies. Arduino looks like a good tool for kids to learn electronics and programming. Because of its functionality and open hardware and software nature, Arduino is a good option for kids. In addition, they can become familiar with fundamental electronic components and design. Thus, Arduino helps children boost their thinking ability in a new dimension. We apply Arduino to teach essential electronic circuits and computer programming components to successfully solve different computing and electronic problems, such as turning on and off a set of lights and reading sensors to react regarding the obtained values. Given the relevance of the problem-solving competence, the open nature of Arduino, and the applicability of Arduino to develop programming competence using block-based programming languages, this article aims the development of problem-solving and computer programming competencies in primary school children. A relevant associated result is that children who participated in the experiment improved their average score in school. These children are from a primary school in Valparaíso, Chile. The main limitations in this experiment were the children's lack of experience with electronics and programming concepts and the requirement of using a computer with an internet connection.","","978-1-6654-5496-4","10.1109/ISMCR56534.2022.9950596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9950596","problem-solving;programming;Arduino;children;competencies","Computer languages;Programming;Turning;Software;Hardware;Sensors;Problem-solving","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;electronic design automation;electronic engineering education;microcontrollers;programming languages;teaching","Arduino;Chile;computing programming competencies;developing countries;electronic circuits;electronic components;electronic design;electronic learning;high-level block-based programming languages;Internet connection;preschool;primary school children;problem-solving competencies;programming classes;programming learning;secondary school;Valparaiso","","","","15","IEEE","24 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There-fore, improving the utilization of network resources is of great significance to the application and development of VR video in order to provide a better quality of experience. Currently, many VR video streaming solutions are based on 360° video, which is a compromise between restricted bandwidth and streaming delay requirement. For a tile-based 360° video streaming using HTTP2 protocol, the video is split into different tiles with multiple quality levels. In the case of insufficient bandwidth, a limited number of quality levels will lead to large quality differences between adjacent zones, which will also limit the optimization of quality level adaptation, resulting in a lower QoE. In this paper, we propose a new tile-based 360° video adaptive streaming scheme based on multiple video quality levels. The proposed method provides more video quality options/levels, dividing the 360° video into different video zones according to its viewpoint position and assign them with different video quality levels based on bandwidth conditions during the streaming time, to achieve smooth video quality distribution, and ensure high QoE with high video bitrate, low-quality switches and minimized stall time. The experimental results show that the QoE of this proposed method is improved by approximately 28% compared with the existing adaptive 360° video streaming scheme.","","978-0-7381-2394-3","10.1109/UCC48980.2020.00063","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9302805","virtual reality;360° video;adaptive streaming;quality of experience;tiles","Streaming media;Quality of experience;Video recording;Quality assessment;Bandwidth;Quality of service;Delays","hypermedia;quality of experience;transport protocols;video coding;video streaming;virtual reality","360° video adaptive streaming scheme;multiple video qualities;emerging multimedia service;virtual reality video streaming;bandwidth requirements;strict delay requirements;quality of experience;VR video streaming solutions;restricted bandwidth;streaming delay requirement;tile-based 360° video streaming;different tiles;multiple quality levels;insufficient bandwidth;quality differences;quality level adaptation;tile-based 360° video adaptive;multiple video quality levels;different video zones;different video quality levels;bandwidth conditions;streaming time;smooth video quality distribution;high video bitrate;low-quality switches;existing adaptive 360° video streaming scheme","","1","","33","IEEE","30 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different methodological approaches and different tools have been used in the assessment of brain-injured patient's navigational abilities. These procedures include auto-evaluation questionnaires, evaluation of general cognitive level, mental rotation tasks or specifically suited visual-spatial tasks. All these methodologies have shown a moderate correlation between the results of these kinds of evaluation and the navigational ability impairment observed in everyday contexts. Meanwhile, the evaluation of patient's spatial orientation out of laboratory setting appears to be an unprofitable opportunity for clinicians. Thus the problem in designing an effective assessment tool is still open. A promising approach could be to integrate classical evaluation tools with computer-based interactive ones, such as virtual reality. According to this framework, we propose a combination of classical and virtual reality-based assessment, in which perceptive, memory and attentional functions (that combined each other are considered the hub for spatial orientation ability) will be evaluated with standardized neuropsychological tests and a more situated computer-based tools will allow the assessment of spatial orientation during the interaction with complex environments. Strictly linked with ""paper and pencil"" spatial disorientation neuropsychological evaluation, we propose two 3D virtual reality tools based on Wisc-R Maze subtest and road map test, customized to match interactive evaluation requirements. The first will provide the possibility to evaluate human ability of finding the best route to achieve a target goal while immersed in an empty environment. The second can be used to evaluate the ability in creating relationships between various points of the environment and in inferring, through the reasoning process, high-level spatial organization knowledge. By providing the possibility to track user's spatial behaviours, a virtual reality-based evaluation allows an effective and objective record of all the experimental variables. It also avoids the intervention of the experimenter, which may interfere with the actions of the agent-explorer.

Unfortunately, practical aspects are not as developed as theoretical ones are despite distance education is being promoted from many sectors. Traditionally, simulators have been the first option to provide an experimental environment. However, simulators are far from provide real-life operation conditions or the disadvantages that real systems have. The experimentation allows students the interaction with real components, equipment and instruments, the verification of the theoretical laws governing the behavior of electric and electronic circuits or the analysis of non-desired effects. Unfortunately, laboratory resources are limited because of their availability, costs, requirement of specialized personnel during practical sessions, etc. This restraint induces in students a trend to address practical experiences separately from theoretical contents, as if they were two activities non-related to each other. The emergence of remote laboratories has provided new horizons in the learning process and has brought new challenges in teaching design. Remote laboratories are being used in many ways and obeying different learning strategies.

In general, the distribution of alignment errors for optical see-through calibration are not isotropic, and one can estimate its distribution based on interaction requirements of a given calibration process and the user's measurable head motion and hand-eye coordination characteristics. Current calibration methods, however, mostly utilize the Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) method which minimizes Euclidean distances for HMD projection matrix estimation, disregarding the anisotropicity in the alignment errors. We utilize the error covariance in order to take the anisotropic nature of error distribution into account. The main hypothesis of this study is that using Mahalonobis distance within the nonlinear optimization can improve the accuracy of the HMD calibration. The simulation results indicate that our new method outperforms the standard DLT method both in accuracy and precision, and is more robust against user alignment errors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that anisotropic noise has been accommodated in the optical see-through HMD calibration.","2375-5334","978-1-5090-6647-6","10.1109/VR.2017.7892255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7892255","augmented reality;HMD;calibration;error propagation;Mahalonobis distance","Calibration;Resists;Robustness;Adaptive optics;Nonlinear optics;Standards;Uncertainty","augmented reality;calibration;helmet mounted displays;matrix algebra;nonlinear programming;user interfaces","robust optical see-through head-mounted display calibration;user interaction errors;augmented reality;point correspondence measurement;alignment error distribution;user measurable head motion;hand-eye coordination characteristics;direct linear transformation method;Euclidean distances;HMD projection matrix estimation;alignment error anisotropicity;error covariance;Mahalonobis distance;nonlinear optimization;standard DLT method;anisotropic noise","","7","","4","IEEE","6 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, aiming at grasping and manipulating objects in immersive VE (iVE) demands force feedback to multiple fingers; thus, a multi-finger hand exoskeleton is required. In this paper, we propose an underactuated haptic two-finger hand exoskeleton that meets the above challenges for grasping and manipulation within an iVE. Three experiments were conducted to test the fingertip tracking and haptic capabilities within fingers’ RoM (Range Of Motion). Results showed that the hand exoskeleton enables contacting virtual objects with two fingers, facilitating manipulation afterward; in addition, free motion inside the iVE is possible due to the wearability of the system.","2642-3766","978-1-6654-5508-4","10.1109/CCE56709.2022.9975913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9975913","Haptic interface;Hand exoskeleton;Underactuation;Immersive virtual reality","Tracking;Wearable computers;Ergonomics;Exoskeletons;Force feedback;Virtual environments;Grasping","dexterous manipulators;ergonomics;force feedback;haptic interfaces;manipulators;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","anthropomorphic movement;design requirements;grasping;haptic capabilities;haptic hand exoskeletons;human-in-the-loop functional specifications;immersive haptic wearable hand exoskeleton;immersive VE;immersive virtual reality;iVE;manipulating objects;multifinger hand exoskeleton;multiple fingers;two-finger hand;virtual environment;virtual objects","","","","16","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We introduce our design and implementation of a Digital Pipeline in this paper. Our implementation focuses on pipeline GIS (Geographic Information System) and VR (Virtual Reality) applications. We mainly introduce pipeline GIS in this paper. The pipeline GIS provides an information framework for Digital Pipeline, it concentrates on two-dimensional (2D) spatial and property data acquiring, storing, processing, analyzing, and sharing in the GIS framework. We divide the pipeline GIS into three modules according to their roles and functionalities: the data management module, the WebGIS module and the data service module. Every module provides corresponding functionality according to user's different data requirement. The data management module is a desktop application that adopts the C/S model. Its objective is to manage pipeline data stored in the GIS server. It also provides professional functionality for pipeline data analyzing, routine administering and maintaining. The WebGIS module is a web-based GIS application that adopts the B/S model. Its purpose is to promote pipeline information sharing by publishing pipeline data to the internet and providing browser-based pipeline data displaying, inquiring, and analyzing. The data service module stores the pipeline database. It provides the data service for the data management module and the WebGIS module. The core of the data service module is the pipeline database, which is an ESRI Geodatabase implementing in terms of a pipeline data model that extending and refining from ArcGIS Pipeline Data Model (APDM).

Since all the new technological development and device require the user to be connected to the internet so as to reduce the burden on the user's device, the bandwidth required has increased tremendously. The introduction of virtual reality and augmented reality has further increased the bandwidth requirement for video streaming due to the large amount of data that would need to be delivered through the internet in a short period of time. The lack of any sophisticated methods to combat these challenges have made it difficult to stream high quality video while ensuring a good quality of service to the user. This paper provides a novel approach to overcome the difficulties faced while streaming high quality video content that requires a high bandwidth. There are two algorithms that are proposed in this approach, the first algorithm involves calculating the number of users who are viewing a video content and then determining the path through which the video packets would be sent to the user. The video content is then cached in the node which is closer to all the nearby video requesters, so that the user can get the video content from the cached data thereby reducing the resources that are needed to stream the video content. The second method involves prefetching the video content from the cache during the presence of a good channel condition so that the user can view the video even during bad channel conditions. The hidden Markov model is used to predict the channel conditions and to calculate the amount of video content that needs to be pre fetched to avoid overflow and under flow of video content data. The two approaches work together to provide video streaming services to a large number of users at a lower resource usage. Since the video packets are only transmitted to the cached location once, while there would be many users streaming the same video from that cache in that area, we can effectively reduce the resources needed by a large margin under certain conditions.","","978-1-7281-2119-2","10.1109/ICSSIT46314.2019.8987811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8987811","video streaming;bandwidth;Markov Model;Channel Condition;quality","","cache storage;hidden Markov models;Internet;storage management;video signal processing;video streaming;virtual reality","forward video streaming;high bandwidth network;video packets;optimized cache;Internet;technological development;virtual reality;user device;quality of service;high quality video content streaming;video content prefetching;hidden Markov model;channel condition","","","","13","IEEE","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There has been a significant advancement in the optics, but the instruments have many limitations. They have deprived ergonomics, single function and limited degrees of freedom. Hence, there is a need for the development of improved instruments. Training in neurosurgery for these procedures involves physical/ synthetic and virtual simulators. Virtual training modules are being developed for the training of surgical procedures and validation of surgical skills. For both these requirements, the virtual model of related neurosurgical instruments is the primary requirement. In the present work, we have developed a virtual repository of microscopic and neuro-endoscopic instruments of neurosurgery. The surface data of these instruments was acquired using blue light scanning technique and processed using computer aided designing to create solid models. These virtual models can be used for surgeon specific modification in the existing designs and for creating new designs.

Besides, e-learning or virtual learning has benefited for visually impaired (VI) learners. There are several studies confirmed that VI learners acknowledge the potentials and advantages of e-learning or virtual learning systems. However, not like sighted learning, VI learners face several challenges in using e-learning materials which are available on the shelf. Most of the virtual learning environments are designed for sighted learning and rich utilization of images and interactivities result the restrictions for the VI to use learning platforms in a virtual environment. Most of the VI learners are relying on screen reader to translate the contents from screen or documents. Thus, careful consideration is important in designing the learning environment for VI according to their requirements and accessibility to provide engaging virtual learning environment for them. Hence, this paper proposes a 3D enabled olfactory, haptic and audio (3DOHA) enhanced application for visually impaired learners to use in a virtual learning environment and evaluates the proposed application by conducting a pilot testing. Based on the study conducted, all the participants in this study agreed that the proposed system is fun to use and they would recommend it to their fellow friends to use in learning.

This paper investigates the use of IEEE 802.11ad for indoor environments with high density of users. To provide high data rates to each user and avoid collisions over a single channel, we propose the use of beamforming using massive antenna arrays, coupled with a frequency allocation scheme for IEEE 802.11ad.

Motivated by the idea, in this paper, we propose a systematic approach to design and implement the virtual motion constraints for a multi-functional virtual manipulation system. The motion constraints are generated from sets of virtual walls, built of different shapes and physical properties, to deal with the compliance task, which involves both position and force management. An algorithm on how to properly assemble the walls and a graphics-based method for smooth force rendering between them are proposed for given compliance tasks.

Whatever is the chosen approach, there is a requirement for a robust human-machine interface for the control, able to understand patient's intention and to produce an immediate activation of the device.

However, it will be necessary to provide human-machine interfaces for interventions in unexpected situations like system-deadlocks, algorithm failures or inabilities. Using virtual or mixed reality-technologies, multi-modal teleoperation offers potential for being a suitable human-machine interface. Essential challenges in this field are, among others, a real-time remote control, a time-efficient and holistic environment detection using multiple sensors, a noise-reduced visualization of sensor-data, and capabilities of object recognition. This paper summarizes research results regarding an architecture capable of a near realtime, interoperable, and operator-supporting teleoperation. The focus of this paper is on a method to efficiently process and visualize point-clouds to meet high frame rate demands of virtual reality applications. To provide near real-time feedback of the robot and its environment over large distances, the presented method is capable to segment known objects from unknown objects to reduce bandwidth requirements. The results of this paper were evaluated using a industrial articulated robotic arm for teleoperation via a long distance UDP/IP communication.","2153-0866","978-1-5386-8094-0","10.1109/IROS.2018.8594053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8594053","","Cameras;Calibration;Solid modeling;Robot vision systems;Task analysis","control engineering computing;image reconstruction;image segmentation;industrial manipulators;man-machine systems;mobile robots;object recognition;real-time systems;robot vision;telerobotics;virtual reality","model segmentation;autonomous mobile robot systems;human-machine interfaces;virtual reality-technologies;mixed reality-technologies;multimodal teleoperation;real-time remote control;noise-reduced visualization;object recognition;operator-supporting teleoperation;real-time feedback;industrial articulated robotic arm;real-time environment reconstruction;VR-based teleoperation;known object segmentation;point-cloud visualization;long distance UDP/IP communication","","11","","16","IEEE","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When transmitting an omnidirectional 360° video over the Inter-net, it consumes considerably more data compared to traditional video streaming. To overcome the high network requirements and still reach a high Quality of Experience, HTTP adaptive streaming technology is considered for 360° video streaming. In contrast to traditional streaming, the adaptation logic considers not only the current network conditions, but also the viewport of the user, i.e., which part of the 360° sphere the user is currently focusing on. However, as the viewport of the user might change anytime, the adaptation logic is required to accurately predict the viewport in the next seconds of the playback to allow for an efficient and smooth streaming with a high visual quality.In this paper, we present novel linear programs that determine the optimal visual quality, which is reachable in a given network scenario using different approaches for viewport prediction.

Furthermore, there is a need for users to think critically about their information requirements in a specific context and then assess the relevance of different online resources to meet these needs.

Thus a virtual design center (VDC) concept using the distributed resources, with real time audio and video interfaces between individuals at the distributed locations, is of utmost importance. With digital connectivity techniques such as integrated services digital network (ISDN) and frame relay becoming available around the public switched telephone network, the virtual design center concepts can be implemented more efficiently using these methodologies.

For more than 20 years, laboratories and specialized equipment were developed and operated for the evaluation of aircraft self-protection. Most of these systems were originally designed on a standalone basis to answer specific questions. On the other hand, operational requests followed an ad-hoc process that did not allow traceability and knowledge management. As these systems are complementary, their integration came as a logical path to increase the capability. This paper presents an overview of the VPG SoS, including the individual systems, the common architecture framework and the services that are key to a comprehensive approach: collaborative tools and computer-assisted processes. The paper also introduces the SoS inner capability to evolve and discusses the benefits of the approach. The VPG links hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) systems within a common virtual environment. The simulation includes not only services like time and error management, but also a robust execution engine that allows the execution of a broad variety of digital models. It was designed to facilitate reusability by flexible composition schemes and standardized interfaces. Like building blocks, the SoS allows the substitution of digital models with their HWIL counterparts. The decision to use a digital or hardware component must be based on the requirements for a specific level of fidelity or performance. The SoS extends beyond the sole integration of software and hardware systems. It also includes a set of collaborative tools with associated processes, and implements an overarching verification and validation methodology. The collaborative tools are developed to facilitate the communication and interaction, and bring a cultural change within the operational community. More than just a database or a portal, it unifies the way requests are managed by the stakeholders by clarifying the roles and responsibilities; it centralizes data from databases that were up to now located in different places; and finally, it greatly fosters knowledge management and robust problem solving within the organization.","","978-1-4673-0750-5","10.1109/SysCon.2012.6189501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189501","simulation;collaborative environment;computer-assisted processes","Atmospheric modeling;Object oriented modeling;Analytical models;Aircraft;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Laboratories","aerospace simulation;knowledge management;military aircraft;military computing;problem solving;virtual reality","system of systems simulation;military aircraft protection assessment;virtual proving ground;aircraft protection engineering;aircraft protection training;VPG SoS;collaborative tools;computer-assisted processes;hardware-in-the-loop systems;virtual environment;knowledge management;problem solving","","2","","3","IEEE","26 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The object based parallel rendering system (OBPRS) that is based on the image composition architecture is proposed and the objective of the OBPRS is to remove the disadvantages of the image composition architecture. According to the simulation results with a 64-renderer system, the OBPRS takes only about 80% of the rendering time of the image composition architecture.

The Lazy Eye Syndrome is tackled here through an interactive holographic application implemented on Microsoft HoloLens device. It provides an entertaining way for the handicapped eye workout as it is based on a simple game of skill. The game is designed in a way that the majority of aware-requiring objects and events are displayed for the cured eye only, remaining the other eye responsible for background and additional information perception. Such disproportion forces an increased activity of the lazy eye, which is to perform more movements and impose the brain to process the sight more extensively. The proposed prototype is an extension of a novel approach towards treating amblyopia, employing software-based stimulation techniques, which could be easily adapted to various age and ability correlated needs of the user, with minimal requirements regarding the exercise setting and preparation.","","978-83-949419-5-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8511186","","Games;Vision defects;Pediatrics;Medical treatment;Visualization;Virtual reality;Training","augmented reality;computer games;eye;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;virtual reality;vision defects;visual perception","mixed reality technology;amblyopia care;interactive holographic application;Microsoft HoloLens device;handicapped eye workout;simple game;cured eye;software-based stimulation techniques;amblyopia therapy;lazy eye syndrome","","1","","27","","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the expected immersive rich media streaming experience is hindered by excessive bandwidth requirements of high-resolution 360° content. It is essential to devise technologies that enable persistent delivery of such bandwidth-hungry applications over the best-effort packet networks. Tile-based adaptive streaming is one of such techniques that support differentiated streaming of quality-variable tiles depending on their position within the viewport. This paper proposes a weighted tile-based approach for 360° video streaming. First, a content-agnostic viewport prediction approach is proposed. Second, a novel viewport and bitrate adaptation heuristic solution which dynamically selects the coverage of the viewport and its marginal regions and allocates weights to the tiles in these regions is introduced. Finally, suitable video bitrates for each tile based on its weight and available network throughput is allocated. The solution is tested and assessed in comparison with alternative approaches resulting in improved viewport quality and lower bandwidth utilization.","2155-5052","978-1-7281-5784-9","10.1109/BMSB49480.2020.9379517","European Regional Development Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9379517","Tile-based technique;360° video;Viewportdependent streaming;Adaptive streaming;Weight allocation","Bit rate;Bandwidth;Virtual reality;Streaming media;Throughput;Resource management;Multimedia communication","image resolution;quality of service;telecommunication traffic;video streaming;virtual reality","bitrate adaptation heuristic solution;allocates weights;suitable video bitrates;available network throughput;improved viewport quality;weighted tile-based approach;viewport adaptive 360° video streaming;virtual reality;media applications;expected immersive rich media streaming experience;excessive bandwidth requirements;high-resolution 360° content;bandwidth-hungry applications;best-effort packet networks;tile-based adaptive streaming;quality-variable tiles;content-agnostic viewport prediction approach","","2","","31","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first step is to detect the markers fixed on the drogue and match them as a circle. The second step is to improve the image robustness.

It also develops a design and implementation of a Wireless Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Sensor Array. By placing sensors on one's arm, hand, upper leg and lower leg, data needed by the application developers to represent the body pose of the user in a virtual environment is provided at a minimum frame rate of 100 Hz. A central processing unit fuses all data and sends it over to a PC. Data fusion and processing algorithms consider the position of the sensors using a quaternion representation. This allows the sensor array to represent coherently the sensed movements and correct the errors of the gyroscope by using magnetic sensors data. Since this system is not tethered by wires and there is no requirement for the user to stay in a camera's field of view (FOV), the user has the full freedom of motion in a 3D Virtual Environment while equipped with a Virtual Reality (VR) headset. In a more complex setup, data from the Sensor Array can be fused with data provided by a 3D camera in order to bring the real or the avatar image of the user in the virtual environment. A general architecture of the Sensor Array System is provided. The architecture is designed to take into account the integration with the Sensor Array of other devices specific to the VR field, such as infrared cameras, joysticks, VR headsets and other game controllers. The functionality of the Sensor Array is finally illustrated by results obtained from real movements of the user while exploring a virtual environment.","","978-1-4799-9911-8","10.1109/SACI.2015.7208184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208184","inertial measurement unit;sensor array;magnetic angular rate and gravity;pose estimation;virtual reality;virtual environments;human-computer interaction","Arrays;Quaternions;Three-dimensional displays;Cameras;Estimation;Joints;Legged locomotion","gyroscopes;inertial navigation;magnetic sensors;sensor arrays","sensor array system;3D body estimation;parts movements;users limb;body movements;wireless inertial measurement unit;IMU sensor array;virtual environment;central processing unit;data fusion;quaternion representation;gyroscope errors;magnetic sensors data;camera field of view;FOV;virtual reality;VR headset","","1","","13","IEEE","20 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially, two important concepts, intelligent entity in running state and collaborative federation, are proposed to take time factor into consideration. Although the definition and static relation description are complete in RACVE model, it is still deficient in describing time-based dynamic state transition of system. The RACVE model represents only a traditional 3D system; actually, CVE is a kind of 4D system with time as its fourth dimension. In order to represent time factor explicitly and describe dynamic state of system, a Fuzzy-Timing Petri Nets formal modeling technique is employed to revise RACVE model to satisfy 4D and real-time requirement of CVE.

It has been widely accepted by teachers and learners in their learning process. Most recently, virtual edutainment has become one of the popular ways for educating the younger generation as it provides an interactive and fun way in learning new things. However, there are limitations when it comes to educate the visually impaired using virtual application as the visually impaired do not have the privilege of sight. It is very difficult to develop engaging edutainment application for those who are visually impaired because they can be easily distracted as they can only hear the sound of video or application. Hence, the usage of edutainment application is very low among visually impaired learners. Therefore, this research studies the requirements of olfactory, haptic and audio enabled 3D application for visually impaired user in a virtual edutainment environment. The preliminary study was conducted on visually impaired people by providing actual shapes of the objects. Based on the results, the main reasons of underutilizing edutainment applications are too much of visual content involved in edutainment applications as well as lack of interaction.

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a powerful paradigm that significantly improves the quality of service (QoS) of these applications by offloading computation and deploying services at the network edge. Existing works on service placement in MEC usually ignore the impact of the different requirements of QoS among service providers (SPs), which is common in many applications such that online game requires extremely low latency and online video requires extremely large bandwidth. Considering the competitive relationship among SPs, we propose an auction-based resource allocation mechanism. We formulate the problem as a social welfare maximization problem to maximize effectiveness of allocated resources while maintaining economic robustness. According to our theoretical analysis, this problem is NP-hard, and thus it is practically impossible to derive the optimal solution. To tackle this, we design multiple rounds of iterative auctions mechanism (MRIAM), which divides resources into blocks and allocates them through multiple rounds of auctions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that our auction-based mechanism is effective in resource allocation and robust in economics.","2690-5965","978-1-7281-9074-7","10.1109/ICPADS51040.2020.00043","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1004704); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61832005,61872171); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M661709); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9359179","Mobile edge computing;service placement;auction theory;computing offloading;quality of service","Economics;Solid modeling;Quality of service;Games;Virtual reality;Computational efficiency;Resource management","computational complexity;distributed processing;iterative methods;mobile computing;optimisation;quality of service;resource allocation","service placement;computation offloading;mobile edge computing;virtual reality;online game;latency-sensitive requirements;MEC;QoS;network edge;service providers;auction-based resource allocation mechanism;social welfare maximization problem;quality of service;NP-hard problem;multiple rounds of iterative auctions mechanism;MRIAM","","2","","21","IEEE","25 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Enabling remote access to such a system would benefit any micro/nanoresearcher. However, vision feedback and sensor data of a micromanipulation system are generally limited, hence the implementation of a teleoperation scenario is not straightforward. Specific tools are proposed here for an intuitive manipulation in a wide range of applications. To ensure ease of manipulation, both a 3D virtual representation of the scene and haptic feedback are provided. Force sensor feedback is limited since only two measures are available. In order to extend this information, vision algorithms are developed to estimate the respective positions of the tool and objects, which are then used to calculate the haptic feedback. The stability of the overall scheme is very sensitive to time delays. This requirement is taken into account in vision algorithms and the communication module which transfers the data between the two remote sites. In addition, the proposed robotic control architecture is modular so that the platform can be used for a wide range of applications.

In this paper, the grid system is used to divide the map into two values to determine the passable area and the threat area. In the route planning, the pheromone concentration and heuristic information are set based on the ant colony algorithm, and the heuristic factor is improved on the basis of the traditional ant colony algorithm. Thus, the improved algorithm can solve a feasible path and speed up the convergence speed. At the same time, Dubins curve is used to curve the solution path, so that the path can meet the requirements of flight curvature of UAV.

Cascading key frame selection using our vocabulary structure can be put the matching process forward, which gives us a way to employ a cascading feature matching strategy to combine matching results of cascading vocabulary tree and key frame.

Human motion tracking provides critical information for intelligent human-computer collaboration. This paper evaluates a camera motion capture system which registers foot movements of an user.

A Kalman filter fusion algorithm which combines the measurements of these systems is developed. This algorithm unifies the advantages of both systems: high localization accuracy from the opti-track motion capture system and no occlusion problem from the electro-magnet system.

Designers have now to explore a design space including both per-accelerator architectural parameters as well as inter-accelerator combinations, i.e. different design configurations among the allocated accelerators, as each accelerator instance has different computational requirements, according to different input data, while throughput and area constraints should be met as well. Under such a system scenario, virtual platform prototyping suffers from increased design time phases, since it requires an exponentially larger number of evaluations to succeed adequate coverage of the design space. In this paper, we propose a co-design framework on top of virtual prototyping solution, customized for many-accelerator heterogeneous systems. The proposed framework defines separate configurations for each accelerator component of the virtual platform, instead of using only one common configuration, thus succeeding to meet both the area and the throughput constraints. In addition, as the design space size increases exponentially, the proposed framework utilizes process-based reconfigurable SystemC modules to intelligently bypass the non-productive simulation stages, thus delivering faster hardware/software co-design cycles. A case study emulating an heterogeneous server system for simultaneous video decoding of multiple streams shows the efficiency of the proposed approach, delivering design solutions with up to 1.58× improved area or 1.59× improved throughput, while achieving simulation time gains of 40%.","","978-1-4799-3770-7","10.1109/SAMOS.2014.6893188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6893188","","Hardware;Computational modeling;Software;Throughput;Servers;Synchronization","C language;hardware-software codesign;multiprocessing systems;virtual prototyping;virtual reality","accelerator heterogeneous systems;virtual platforms;modern multiprocessor heterogeneous systems;hardware accelerators;accelerator architectural parameters;inter-accelerator combinations;design configurations;computational requirements;throughput constraints;area constraints;virtual platform prototyping;design space;accelerator component;process-based reconfigurable SystemC modules;hardware/software co-design cycles","","4","","17","IEEE","8 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the process of image acquisition and transmission, the illumination of the object, the light reflection on the surface of the object, the noise collected by the camera equipment when collecting the image, and the interference suffered by the image transmission are all reasons for the deterioration of the image quality. Some errors may occur in the process of image transformation, feature collection, image stitching, etc., so that the practical level of computer vision cannot be rapidly improved. Among them, the thresholding method is a commonly used method for image segmentation. At present, there are many threshold segmentation methods, such as the minimum error threshold method, the maximum between-class variance method and the best histogram entropy method. However, this method is only suitable for low-contrast image color enhancement processing, and the effect of high-contrast image color enhancement processing is general, which cannot meet the user’s requirements for the color of highway landscape visual images. In essence, it is a group iteration process of the niche genetic algorithm, starting from any initial group, based on the principle of evolution. Through the role of competition, selection, reproduction, variation, and so on, similar to the genetic evolution of organisms. Based on the previous research results, eight evaluation indexes are initially determined as ""vividness, openness, diversity, interference, naturalness, coordination, management, balance"". This kind of image will be affected by internal and external factors when it is collected. Global search optimal feature which causes color quality degradation of highway landscape visual image can get better processing effect quickly. The weight maps of the two visual images of highway environment landscape are calculated to enhance the visual image of highway environment landscape. The algorithm has the problem of uneven gray distribution of the visual image. This paper mainly focuses on the visual image enhancement algorithm simulation results of highway environment landscape by using the genetic algorithm.

However, most of the existing CVEs supporting systems are tuned to specific tasks and their architecture are, typically, tightly coupled to the applications. This makes any modification to the application dependent on programming, making CVEs construction and extension in large scale a challenging task. The ability to change an application without having to stop it is an important nonfunctional requirement for CVEs, especially if they are to be provided as Web services, available around the clock. This paper presents a novel solution for building and extending CVEs through the integration of interactive non-linear stories and virtual reality concepts. With this approach, CVEs applications can be composed as non-linear stories, which can be changed either completely or partly, making it easier for developers to build and/or extend CVEs applications. The innovative concept of this solution can make the development process of CVEs easier and faster, allowing their production in large scale. An art installation scenario is presented in this paper as a case study to illustrate how atomic simulations and VEML language can describe CVEs and extend them at runtime.","1550-6525","0-7695-2462-1","10.1109/DISTRA.2005.5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1530657","","Collaboration;Virtual environment;Large-scale systems;World Wide Web;Web services;Clocks;Buildings;Virtual reality;Production;Art","groupware;virtual reality;Internet;digital simulation","collaborative virtual environment simulations;World Wide Web;CVE supporting systems;Web services;virtual reality;atomic simulations;VEML language","","12","","17","IEEE","14 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since most endovascular procedures involve performing fine motor control tasks that require complex, dexterous movements, this paper explores the potential for a standardized, objective, and quantitative means of measuring technical competence based on analysis of the kinematics of endovascular tool tip motions. To accomplish this goal, we recorded catheter tip movement from twenty subjects performing fundamental endovascular tasks in an inanimate model and in a simulation environment with a virtual representation of the same inanimate model. Several motion-based performance measures that have been shown to reliably assess skill in other domains were computed and tested for correlation with data that were obtained from the global rating scale assessment tool. The metrics that quantified movement quality by assessing movement smoothness produced reliable correlations with the observation-based assessment metrics. These objective and quantitative metrics that capture movement quality could be incorporated into future training protocols to provide detailed feedback on trainee performance.","1062-922X","978-1-4799-3840-7","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974411","virtual reality;motion capture;skill assessment","Measurement;Surgery;Catheters;Solid modeling;Computational modeling;Correlation;Manuals","image capture;image motion analysis;medical image processing;surgery;virtual reality","objective metrics;surgical skills evaluation;tool motion;key competency requirement;endovascular surgery;preshaped catheter;complex vascular anatomy;performance assessment techniques;endovascular procedure;fine motor control task;endovascular tool tip motion;catheter tip movement;simulation environment;virtual representation;inanimate model;motion-based performance measure;global rating scale assessment tool;quantified movement quality;movement smoothness;observation-based assessment metrics;quantitative metric;capture movement quality;training protocol;trainee performance","","16","","27","IEEE","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The three-dimensional solid model of the manipulator is established by using the design software, and the motion simulation analysis of the solid model is carried out to obtain its motion law. The results of motion analysis show that the speed of the manipulator changes smoothly in the motion process, and the change of speed has little effect on the stability of the objects grasped by the manipulator.

Thus, we investigate the following topics pertaining to assembly works and gamification: (a) how is the future of industrial assembly; (b) what methods are currently used to train the assembly workers; and (c) is gamification prospective for such training. From 20 out of 53 related studies, we eventually found the most relevant literatures. The results indicate that traditional training has not met the requirements of future trends, while augmented reality training methods, may offer extra benefits than the counterparts.

The dental preparation requires the robotic system to own high accuracy, high ablation speed and small size. A 2D galvanometer scanners module is integrated to meet the requirement of a high moving speed of the laser focus. A closed-loop system based on a miniature-sized voice-coil motor and a grating ruler are developed to realize the accurate control of the focus. The overall size of the developed prototype is 108mm×56mm×43mm, which is small enough to be used in close proximity to a patient's mouth. The prototype has been tested by using two different kinds of laser generators, i.e., a nanosecond laser and a picosecond laser. The experiment results show that the robotic system can provide high moving speed of 1000mm/s with good shape accuracy. From the results, we found that nanosecond laser beam can be controlled to ablate zirconia and aluminum, but not suitable to ablate tooth because of tissue carbonization. By selecting suitable parameters of the picosecond laser generator, a target tooth could be ablated to produce a cylinder shape without carbonization. Limitations of the prototype are identified according to the experiment results.","2153-0866","978-1-4673-6358-7","10.1109/IROS.2013.6696718","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6696718","","Laser beams;Teeth;Laser ablation;Dentistry;Robots;Lenses;Accuracy","aluminium;biological tissues;closed loop systems;coils;dentistry;galvanometers;high-speed optical techniques;laser applications in medicine;medical robotics;microrobots;motion control;tissue engineering;zirconium compounds","miniature robotic system;tooth ablation;ultrashort pulsed lasers;automatic dental preparation system;clinical operations;three-dimensional space movement;hard tissue removal;high ablation speed;2D galvanometer scanners module;laser focus;closed-loop system;miniature-sized voice-coil motor;grating ruler;patient mouth;nanosecond laser beam;zirconia ablation;aluminum ablation;tissue carbonization;picosecond laser generator;cylinder shape","","5","","11","IEEE","2 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a fog-based architecture for remote phobia treatment, a Tactile Internet application. The proposed architecture offers a set of software modules that allow a phobia patient to have a therapy session, under the guidance of an expert therapist located remotely, with the patient and the therapist sharing the same virtual reality environment. We use the fog paradigm to meet the stringent Tactile Internet requirements, namely the round trip latency of 1ms.

By understanding salient image regions, the compression, transmission and rendering algorithms can be optimized. This is particularly important in omnidirectional images (ODIs) viewed with a head-mounted display (HMD), where only a fraction of the captured scene is displayed at a time, namely viewport. In order to predict salient image regions, saliency maps are estimated either by using an eye tracker to collect eye fixations during subjective tests or by using computational models of visual attention. However, eye tracking developments for ODIs are still in the early stages and although a large list of saliency models are available, no particular attention has been dedicated to ODIs. Therefore, in this paper, we consider the problem of estimating saliency maps for ODIs viewed with HMDs, when the use of an eye tracker device is not possible. We collected viewport center trajectories (VCTs) of 32 participants for 21 ODIs and propose a method to transform the gathered data into saliency maps. The obtained saliency maps are compared in terms of image exposition time used to display each ODI in the subjective tests. Then, motivated by the equator bias tendency in ODIs, we propose a post-processing method, namely fused saliency maps (FSM), to adapt current saliency models to ODIs requirements. We show that the use of FSM on current models improves their performance by up to 20%. The developed database and testbed are publicly available with this paper.","2472-7814","978-1-5386-4024-1","10.1109/QoMEX.2017.7965634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7965634","Fixations;head-mounted display (HMD);omnidirectional images (ODIs);saliency maps;viewport;virtual reality (VR)","Visualization;Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Resists;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Trajectory","data compression;helmet mounted displays;image coding;image representation;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","omnidirectional images;VR applications;graphics;image processing;video processing;robotics;human-computer interaction;salient image regions;compression algorithms;transmission algorithms;rendering algorithms;head-mounted display;HMD;eye tracker;eye fixations;viewport center trajectories;VCTs;image exposition time;fused saliency maps;FSM;ODI representation","","66","1","25","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, straight-forward stereo rendering methods usually are expensive since they render the scene from two eye-points which in general doubles the frame times. This is particularly problematic since virtual reality sets high requirements for real-time capabilities and image resolution. Hence, this paper presents a hybrid rendering system that combines classic rasterization and real-time ray-tracing to accelerate stereoscopic rendering. The system reprojects the pre-rendered left half of the stereo image pair into the right perspective using a forward grid warping technique and identifies resulting reprojection errors, which are then efficiently resolved by adaptive real-time ray-tracing. A final analysis shows that the system achieves a significant performance gain, has a negligible quality impact, and is suitable even for higher rendering resolutions.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-5608-8","10.1109/VR46266.2020.00107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089460","Computing methodologies;Computer Graphics;Rendering;Ray tracing;Rasterization;Graphics systems and interfaces;Virtual reality","Rendering (computer graphics);Ray tracing;Real-time systems;Three-dimensional displays;Acceleration;Stereo image processing;Hardware","","","","1","","42","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, memory and computing power requirements remain as challenges to be tackled in these models. Monocular depth estimation has significant use in robotics and virtual reality that requires deployment on low-end devices. Training a small model from scratch results in a significant drop in accuracy and it does not benefit from pre-trained large models. Motivated by the literature of model pruning, we propose a lightweight monocular depth model obtained from a large trained model. This is achieved by removing the least important features with a novel joint end-to-end filter pruning. We propose to learn a binary mask for each filter to decide whether to drop the filter or not. These masks are trained jointly to exploit relations between filters at different layers as well as redundancy within the same layer. We show that we can achieve around 5x compression rate with small drop in accuracy on the KITTI driving dataset. We also show that masking can improve accuracy over the baseline with fewer parameters, even without enforcing compression loss.","2381-8549","978-1-5386-6249-6","10.1109/ICIP.2019.8803544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8803544","Monocular depth estimation;Filter pruning;Model compression","Training;Estimation;Solid modeling;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Image reconstruction;Real-time systems","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;image filtering;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;virtual reality","lightweight monocular depth estimation model;convolutional neural networks;multiple vision tasks;computing power requirements;virtual reality;lightweight monocular depth model;joint end-to-end filter pruning;KITTI driving dataset","","8","","23","IEEE","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new digital reality focuses on the mandatory formation of competencies which are end-to-end technology-oriented: Big Data, machine learning and artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, robotics, blockchain, Internet of Things, 5G technologies, quantum technologies and others. Considering the speed of the development of these technologies, concerns have arisen about the relevance of the content of educational programs of higher education, as well as the degree of flexibility of educational trajectories of engineering graduates. To ensure the relevance and flexibility, constant revision of training programs regarding the study and development of new paradigms and solutions is required. This paper calls into question how to meet the requirements of the labor market at the time of graduation, considering that the educational programs are compiled at the time of the beginning of education and in accordance with the established federal standards of higher education. The goal is to adjust the results of the educational program or even to introduce completely new results in accordance with the changes that have occurred in the industry at the time of the implementation of the program to ensure students form the most relevant and in-demand competencies. The article describes the approaches of the Institute of Computer Technologies and Information Security (ICTIS) of the Southern Federal University to the creation of flexible, interdisciplinary bachelor’s and master’s degree educational programs. The content of these programs directly corresponds to the current and promising demands of the labor market. The presented approaches to the customization of educational programs meet the needs of students in personal and professional development. These approaches contribute to the development of a student-centered learning system that is specific for each level of education. Project-based learning is a key tool for the formation of relevant professional competencies within bachelor’s degree programs. The master’s degree focuses on the formation of unique research competencies in the context of the current agenda. For this purpose, the ICTIS has opened special research programs that involve a grant system for undergraduates. What is also important is the inclusion of undergraduates in research groups led by postdocs of the Institute. The key principle uniting these approaches into a single system is the introduction of its own educational standards in engineering areas in the ICTIS. The standards of the ICTIS regulate the possibility for students to choose variable professional competencies after mastering the basic educational component. These competencies are formed annually based on the analysis of prospective labor market demands and can be included in the program even after the start of its implementation. The analysis on the results of the ICTIS educational standards implementation has shown the effectiveness of the concept of these standards in the field of computer technology and information security. The effectiveness of this concept of the educational standard allows gradually being implemented in other fields of knowledge.","2165-9567","978-1-6654-4434-7","10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766804","individual educational programs;student-centered education;project-based learning","Training;Educational programs;Information security;Virtual reality;Machine learning;Trajectory;Personnel","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;further education;information technology;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);professional aspects;virtual reality","educational program;end-to-end technology-oriented;higher education;educational trajectories;training programs;Computer Technologies;bachelor;special research programs;educational standard;basic educational component;ICTIS educational standards implementation;computer technology","","","","8","IEEE","11 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The context for this work in progress paper is the recent Irish government guidelines and requirement for all centralized office based knowledge workers in the Republic of Ireland to work from home as a result of the Global Covid-19 pandemic. Individual knowledge workers who previously had worked 80% or more in a centralized office environment were selected as part of a mixed methods research study. The paper has two intended outcomes. First, to provide immediate short term insights to better understand the impact of rapid change of physical work space, due to Covid-19 on knowledge worker attitudes and task outcomes. Second, to use the findings in this paper for further research relating to the requirement to work from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact on knowledge workers across a number of chosen areas of interest relating to workspace learning, productivity and how technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) can improve this experience. The questions posed in this paper are to enable future research and Open Science collaboration beyond that of the Republic of Ireland which could be used to support public sector and private sector organizations to provide more immersive, productive and learning workspaces beyond the Covid-19 pandemic. The full data a survey questions are available in the extended version of this working paper. A Constructivist supported by an epistemological approach encompassing embodied interactions [2] physical determinism [3] and psycho spatial dynamics [4] provide a balance springboard to launch this comparative investigation into this new area of research.","","978-1-7348995-0-4","10.23919/iLRN47897.2020.9155210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155210","knowledge worker productivity;immersive workplaces;workplace learning spaces;Covid-19 working from home;experiential work spaces;workspace productivity;future of workspace;future workforce trends","Productivity;Employment;Tools;Market research;Standards;Task analysis;Collaboration","computer aided instruction;educational computing;groupware;knowledge management;organisational aspects;personnel;virtual reality","COVID-19 pandemic restrictions;perceived value;undifferentiated space;progress paper;recent Irish government guidelines;Global Covid-19 pandemic;individual knowledge workers;centralized office environment;mixed methods research study;intended outcomes;immediate short term insights;physical work space;knowledge worker attitudes;task outcomes;home due;workspace learning;immersive learning workspaces;productive learning workspaces;working paper;physical determinism;work-in-progress-the sudden requirement","","3","","28","","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, user-adaptive delivery mechanisms are a promising solution to exploit the increased range of motion offered by 6DoF VR applications to yield gains in perceived quality of 3D point cloud user representations, while reducing their bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we perform a user study in VR to quantify the gains adaptive tile selection strategies can bring with respect to non-adaptive solutions. In particular, we define an auxiliary utility function, we employ established methods from the literature and newly-proposed schemes for distributing the bit budget across the tiles, and we evaluate them together with non-adaptive streaming baselines through subjective QoE assessment. Results confirm that considerable gains can be obtained with user-adaptive streaming, achieving bit rate gains of up to 65% with respect to a non-adaptive approach to deliver comparable quality.

The world geometric data of an extensive region or terrain may need to be divided in areas, which are distributed across the network. By distributing the data, host memory use and processing power are reduced since less data needs to be received, processed and stored. However, these gains can be easily surpassed by the amount of traffic generated by the synchronization messages transmitted, as well as the processing time due to the control infrastructure and the bulky data transmission of parts of the distributed VE. So, good mechanisms for data distribution management (DDM) are an important requirement for LDVEs. This paper describes the grid filtered region-based (GFRB) DDM scheme, which combines the positive aspects of both region-based and grid-based DDM methods to reduce network traffic and latency in LDVEs using a minimum number of multicast groups. GFRB scheme is unique because it provides a finer grained mechanism to exact match publishers to subscribers with intersecting regions. It does that with a reduced number of messages and multicast groups, by taking into consideration the percentage of overlap of a region on a cell. Experimental results show that GFRB scheme can be a potential solution to data synchronization in large distributed virtual environments.","1944-9410","0-7803-9041-5","10.1109/VECIMS.2005.1567565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1567565","","Environmental management;Large-scale systems;Virtual environment;Distributed decision making;Multidimensional systems;Cities and towns;Management training;Communication system traffic control;Distributed power generation;Data communication","synchronisation;virtual reality;multicast communication;grid computing;groupware","data distribution management;synchronization;large-scale distributed virtual environments;grid filtered region;multicast groups","","","","23","IEEE","10 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through analyzing and comparing several common algorithms of collision detection, a method of real-time collision detection was further developed, including two detecting phases, pre-collision detection and accurate-collision detection. First of all, Radar ranging theory was used in the pre-collision detection as it could predict the possible colliding region to save computer resources effectively. If the pre-collision were true, one collision type would be chosen which determined by the relative direction of two vehicles. Subsequently, an accurate collision detection were about to engage in corresponding to the collision type. Every collision type has its own collision detection algorithms. A mathematic model was built up for the minimal collision distance which ensured the real-time and authenticity of vehicle driving in virtual environment. The results showed that the method was simple and met the demand of real-time, which satisfied the detecting requirements of vehicle driving in the virtual environment. Moreover, it can also be used in other collision detection experiments.","","978-1-4244-2183-1","10.1109/ICINFA.2008.4608305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4608305","Real-time Collision Detection;Vehicle Driving;Virtual Environment;Radar Ranging","Vehicles;Distance measurement;Virtual environment;Real time systems;Vehicle driving;Radar;Detection algorithms","traffic engineering computing;virtual reality","real-time collision detection;vehicle driving;virtual environment;virtual driving;virtual reality system;radar ranging theory;mathematic model;collision distance","","5","1","25","IEEE","26 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a time for 3D calling, virtual reality live streaming and holographic communication; Accessing this type of data requires ultrahigh data rates and traffic volumes, so there is a need to speed up the network and increase bandwidth. On the other hand, a system has to maintain reliability, security, availability and flexibility in a wireless network. The network should be extended to the needs of human life such as entertainment, healthcare, smart cities, and transportation expected to enhance service quality with a high-end user experience. To establish this network, the telecommunications infrastructure must upgrade its unmatched service level requirements. The two major disruptive emerging components in this modern Internet-enabled era of technology are both the blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT). In research and industry, IoT has experienced exponential growth, although it suffers from several limitations, such as poor interoperability, decentralization, privacy, and security vulnerabilities. 6G applications can be based on telecommunications networks and IoT, therefore, the network must ensure strong connectivity between nodes and also ensure the privacy and security of user data. Blockchain is the appropriate solution for these issues. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology and it enables many industries to exchange data over the Internet between trusted parties without using a central server. The blockchain facilitates verifiable, transparent and secure digital asset transactions with proof of right and ownership. There is a need to identify the role of blockchain in 6G networks.

ENC 2004.","18 Oct 2004","2004","","","268","274","Development of visual processing components in embedded systems is a difficult task. The nature of embedded devices not only limits the processing power available to applications, but the limited I/O facilities also considerably hinder development. Several complexities emerge for testing, debugging, quality evaluation and profiling when developing on an embedded device. This means that vision processing algorithms are not only harder to design for embedded systems, but require more time to debug and test than would be the case on a general purpose computing device. However the increase in deployment of robotic systems has seen embedded vision development becoming increasingly necessary in many problem domains. AIBO Vision Workshop 2 (AVW2) is a utility that address these problems associated with vision processing development on embedded systems by providing a flexible, off-line, modularised vision pipeline. That is, AVW2 aids developers in this area as it provides an immersive environment where each step (module) can be flexibly placed in a user configured vision pipeline. The output can then be rigorously inspected and tested. The code of the embedded system is executed in the environment of the AVW2 tool allowing profiling (experimental evaluation of the time requirements of the code).","","0-7695-2160-6","10.1109/ENC.2004.1342616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1342616","","Robot vision systems;Virtual reality;Software testing;Software debugging","robot vision;embedded systems;virtual reality;program testing;program debugging","real-time embedded vision system development;visual processing component;embedded system;limited I/O facility;embedded device testing;embedded device debugging;embedded device quality evaluation;vision processing algorithm;robotic system;AIBO Vision Workshop 2;flexible off-line modularised vision pipeline;immersive environment;user configured vision pipeline","","2","","11","IEEE","18 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The drive from both domains is for more functionality and efficiency from vehicles. The resultant effect on system development means the complexity of the designs has increased and thus the complexity of the virtual simulations used for test and analysis has also increased. When actual systems or their components are integrated with the simulation environment, live-virtual testing places real-time demands on the testing of the architecture and environment. This paper describes a proposed innovative approach, derived from aerospace engineering, where the vehicle requirements are allocated to relations between the elements in the architecture and not just to system elements. An approach to using the relational oriented modelling structure for test and analysis is also described. The requirements and system architecture models specified using relational orientation are therefore seen to provide an early demonstration of a rigorous new approach to system of systems design, test and analysis that uses requirements trace ability at the architecture level. This approach promises to bring better trace ability of system requirements to the simulation of vehicle behaviour in general and to real time behaviour in particular.","2375-5261","978-1-4799-4430-9","10.1109/ISORC.2014.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899174","relational orientation;system architecture;requirement traceability;relation oriented systems engineering;integration;MBSE;models;model driven architecture;environments;frameworks","Unified modeling language;Computer architecture;Analytical models;Data models;Real-time systems;Vehicles","architectural CAD;virtual reality","model based systems engineering;virtual vehicle architecture model;V2AM;live virtual testing;prototyping;aero-auto domains;architecture modelling;systems engineering design;simulation environment;live-virtual testing;aerospace engineering;vehicle requirements;relational oriented modelling structure;system architecture models;relational orientation;system of systems design;requirements trace ability;architecture level;vehicle behaviour;real time behaviour","","","","22","IEEE","18 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This scattered distributed characteristic requires a suitable e-commerce platform to display tourism resources and promote the information exchange between tourists and businesses. However, current multimedia technologies in the development of folkcustom tourism e-commerce system do not directly integrate the heterogeneous and isomerism resource such as geospatial information. It impedes the exhibition of primitive folk custom culture. Towards the goal of exhibition of primitive folk custom culture, an implementation method of integrating folk-custom tourism e-commerce multi-source heterogeneous and isomerism resources for displaying, which is called the Resource Mashup and Display technology (RMD), is presented as a key technology for the proposed scheme. This technology integrates WebGIS, multimedia, Web-3D and virtual reality panorama technologies, and achieves the integrated display for the multi-source heterogeneous and isomerism resources. First of all, using the geospatial information as an integrating link of resources, RMD add geospatial attribute to URI (Universal Resource Identifier) of resources. It realizes spatialization processing for non-geospatial resources. Secondly, by calling the resources via Web API, RMD achieves the 2D/3D Web e-map as the carrier, which combines the graphics, video, audio, virtual reality panoramas and other multi-source heterogeneous and isomerism resources with electronic map on WWW. It provides users a multi-display-mode. Thirdly, for different users' requirements, RMD offers multi-terminal access mode (such as PC, mobile phone, PDA and so on) for users to access via WWW. This paper describes the implementation of RMD and explores the development of village folk-custom tourism e-commerce.

At present, the vehicle-road coordination technology based on 5G MEC and C-V2X is an important evolution direction of the Internet of Vehicles. Vehicle-Infrastructure coordination means that vehicles communicate with surrounding vehicles, roadside traffic infrastructure, and cloud services to obtain information on the status of surrounding vehicles, roadside traffic signals, traffic signs, etc., in order to improve the safe driving ability of vehicles. To realize L3 level and above vehicle-infrastructure collaborative autonomous driving, it is necessary to collaborate with multiple data sources of “people-vehicle-road-environment”. And one of the requirements of vehicle-infrastructure coordination is to present auxiliary information from multiple data sources obtained by rapid inference of AI technology to vehicles in a more intuitive and comprehensive way. It is also a low-latency, high-speed mobile service that requires end-to-end ultra-low latency and high reliability of network communications.

At present, the practical 3D face reconstruction technology is mainly based on the 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) method. However, the collection and production of the 3DMM model are complicated, and the 3DMM model only has a facial part model. As a result, it cannot reconstruct a complete 3D human head and is difficult to apply to actual engineering. To solve those problems, we propose a manual 3D human head reconstruction method, which based on 3DMM. Compared with the traditional 3DMM model production method, the method proposed in this paper reduces the difficulty of production. It adopts the common 3D format so that it can be developed and used by mainstream 3D editing software. In addition, it simplifies the size of the model to make it easy to deploy on mobile devices. Traditional face reconstruction can achieve face reconstruction by directly using the face of the photo as the texture. For head reconstruction, we first made a fixed full-head map, than design algorithm to match the color of the head map with the skin color of the face. Finally, we calculate the affine transformation to transform the face of the photo into the head map and achieve smooth fusion. Aiming at the actual application scenarios, we design the illumination normalization algorithm to deal with the uneven illumination of the face photos, and improves the reconstruction efficiency of the head under the condition of uneven illumination. Experiments show that the above algorithm can reconstruct a realistic 3D human head. The average reconstruction speed on the i7-4790 CPU is only 700ms.","","978-1-6654-1236-0","10.1109/SWC50871.2021.00077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604454","3D morphable model;3D head reconstruction;Illumination normalization","Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Lighting;Production;Color;Virtual reality;Transforms","augmented reality;face recognition;image morphing;image reconstruction;image texture;solid modelling","mainstream 3D editing software;full-head map;face photos;reconstruction efficiency;realistic 3D human head;average reconstruction speed;fast head reconstruction algorithm;single photo;facial part model;complete 3D human head;common 3D format;3DMM model production method;3D morphable model method;virtual reality;augment reality technology","","","","31","IEEE","18 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, data is segmented to identify anatomical structures of interest and visualised using a rendering algorithm. Rendered surfaces in surgical simulators must be updated in real time to reflect user interaction within the virtual environment, such as cutting or drilling. Since its introduction in 1987, marching cubes has become a popular rendering algorithm for use in medical image visualisation, due to its simplicity and speed. However, the algorithm is designed for use with continuous data rather than discrete data, as is the case with segmented data. Applying marching cubes to segmented data results in blocky surfaces that require smoothing. In addition, marching cubes uses a single threshold (iso-value) to define the rendered surface and does not provide a means of rendering surfaces based on an upper and lower threshold (iso-interval). This ability is necessary if we wish to render individual segments within a segmented data volume. We introduce modifications to the marching cubes algorithm to enable the use of iso-intervals to construct smooth surfaces representing different segments from segmented volume data. We also discuss a way to render real-time material removal from the constructed surfaces. Our evaluation shows that the performance of this method compares favourably to an existing method, with decreased memory requirements and shorter start-up times.","1063-7125","978-1-4799-1053-3","10.1109/CBMS.2013.6627760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6627760","","Materials;Rendering (computer graphics);Bones;Anatomical structure;Smoothing methods;Surgery;Mathematical model","biomedical equipment;biomedical MRI;computerised tomography;image segmentation;medical image processing;surgery;virtual reality","marching cube adaptation;material removal simulation;segmented volume data;virtual reality surgical simulators;anatomical models;3D medical image data;MRI scans;CT scans;anatomical structures;user interaction;virtual environment;cutting;drilling;rendering algorithm;medical image visualisation;discrete data;blocky surfaces;rendered surface;marching cube algorithm;isointervals;smooth surfaces;real-time material removal;surface construction","","2","","10","IEEE","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to achieve specific security objectives, the network need to choose the defensive measures under certain conditions. In order to generate the measures implemented by the device, it usually requires manual or automated translation from high-level network defense policy. In the translation process, due to the presence of semantic loss, man-made understanding mistakes, device machinery, etc., the high-level policy requirements cannot be completely satisfied. This will result in hiding network security risks or vulnerabilities. Through analysis of the consistency between high-level policy and low-level measures, and pointing out the lack and redundancy between the policy and measures, it can guide the further translation of policy on the device. This paper presents a novel formal and automated method to verify the consistency. When errors are detected, we will point out the location of the misconfiguration. The same time, based on SMT solving tools, it has been implemented in a prototype of consistency verifier.

The research of vascular interventional surgeon training system based on virtual reality technology is becoming more and more important. The quality of a training system depends on whether it can provide a realistic training environment. In the past, most of the researches mainly focused on the reality of touch, such as the simulation of the force on the guide wire in the blood vessel, but less on the human-computer interaction. A good human-computer interaction can also improve the doctor's operation experience and effect. To solve this problem, this paper built a training system based on augmented reality technology, and proposed gesture interaction to replace the traditional interaction.

In this paper, we present and apply a novel taxonomy that separates redirection techniques according to their geometric flexibility versus the likelihood that they will be noticed by users. Additionally, we conducted a user study of three reorientation techniques, which confirmed that participants were less likely to experience a break in presence when reoriented using the techniques classified as subtle in our taxonomy. Our results also suggest that reorientation with change blindness illusions may give the impression of exploring a more expansive environment than continuous rotation techniques, but at the cost of negatively impacting spatial knowledge acquisition.","2375-5334","978-1-4673-1246-2","10.1109/VR.2012.6180877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6180877","Virtual environments;redirection;taxonomy","Virtual environments;Legged locomotion;Taxonomy;Thyristors;Optical character recognition software;Blindness","computational geometry;knowledge acquisition;virtual reality","immersive virtual environments;redirection techniques;natural walking;geometric flexibility;reorientation techniques;change blindness illusions;continuous rotation techniques;spatial knowledge acquisition","","112","","20","IEEE","12 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The only requirement is the ability to track across frames at least four feature points that are specified by the user at system initialization time and whose world coordinates are unknown. Our approach is based on the following observation: given a set of four or more non coplanar 3D points, the projection of all points in the set can be computed as a linear combination of the projections of just four of the points. We exploit this observation by: tracking lines and fiducial points at frame rate; and representing virtual objects in a non Euclidean, affine frame of reference that allows their projection to be computed as a linear combination of the projection of the fiducial points.","","0-8186-7296-X","10.1109/VRAIS.1996.490507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=490507","","Augmented reality;Calibration;Cameras;Three dimensional displays;Computer displays;Animation;Computer science;Computer graphics;Application software;Data visualization","virtual reality;interactive video;computational geometry","affine object representations;calibration free augmented reality;video based augmented reality system;three dimensional graphical objects;live video;dynamic environments;metric information;calibration parameters;3D locations;feature points;system initialization time;world coordinates;non coplanar 3D points;linear combination;fiducial points;frame rate;virtual objects;non Euclidean affine frame","","37","10","32","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, Vive is applicable in a limited space, which does not fit the requirements of mobile robots. On the other hand, the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms give a low-precision positioning in a wider area. In this paper, we propose a hybrid localization strategy that combines the advantages of Vive and SLAM such that a mobile robot can carry out delicate tasks around a workstation that requires high-precision positioning, and moves among workstations in a wide space with low-precision. To guarantee smooth and reliable transition from the low-precision to the high-precision area, we extend the workspace of Vive with additional lighthouses, and use the result of visual odometry to improve the robustness of Vive system after the tracker reconnection. Then we do experiments to verify the precision of the Vive system and the proposed hybrid localization strategy.","","978-1-6654-9646-9","10.1109/CACS55319.2022.9969805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9969805","indoor position system (IPS);HTC Vive;mobile robots;gmapping;adaptive Monte Carlo localization (AMCL)","Location awareness;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Monte Carlo methods;Tracking;Virtual reality;Robustness;Workstations","distance measurement;indoor radio;mobile robots;Monte Carlo methods;path planning;position control;radionavigation;robot vision;SLAM (robots);tracking;virtual reality","adaptive monte carlo method;high-precision area;high-precision indoor positioning solution;high-precision positioning;HTC Vive system;hybrid localization strategy;hybrid Vive;low-precision positioning;mobile robot;multiprecision indoor localization strategy;SLAM;virtual reality motion tracking devices;wide space;wider area;workstation","","","","19","IEEE","7 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Presently NRC is examining the ways of evolving a hydrogen infrastructure for fuelling hydrogen in fuel cell vehicles. Such an infrastructure will need to be scalable, reliable and cost competitive. Therefore we chose to use the holonic approach for modelling and simulation of such an infrastructure, which presently does not exist and will initially be sparse and highly distributed. This paper describes the original design features of the holonic system architecture, the hydrogen infrastructure requirements and the enhancements we made to the architecture in the process of implementing the test application. We used a 3-D simulation technology to create a virtual hydrogen infrastructure, created holons to proxy its elements (i.e., hydrogen generation, storage and dispensing stations, vehicles and highways with alternate routes) and the interface between the virtual and holonic worlds. We systematically introduce holons which proxy real physical devices, to demonstrate how this architecture could be phased in from a virtual model to the physical world without changing the holonic control.","1062-922X","0-7803-7952-7","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244619","","Pulp manufacturing;Productivity;Robustness;Engines;Assembly;Fuel cell vehicles;Costs;System testing;Hydrogen storage;Road vehicles","fuel cell vehicles;mechanical engineering computing;manufacturing systems;hydrogen storage;engines;solid modelling;digital simulation;virtual reality","holonic system architecture;scalable infrastructures;manufacturing coordination;holonic approach;productivity;robustness;engine assembly line design;hydrogen infrastructure;fuel cell vehicles;3D simulation technology;virtual hydrogen infrastructure;holons;virtual model;physical world","","8","","11","IEEE","17 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We investigated how a robot's violations of social norms under shared autonomy influence the local user's evaluation of the robot's remote users. Specifically, we examined how attribution of such violations to either the robot or the remote user influences social perception of the remote user. Using personal space invasion as a salient social norm violation, we conducted a within-subject experiment (n=20) to investigate these questions. Participants saw several people introducing themselves through a telepresence robot, personal space invasion and attribution were manipulated. We found a significant (p=0.007) joint effect of the manipulations on interpersonal attraction. After these first 20 participants our robot broke down, and we had to continue with another robot (n=20). We found a difference between the two robots, causing us to discard this data from our main analysis. Subsequent video annotation and comparison of the two robots suggests that accuracy of the followed trajectory modifies attribution.

For model-based detection using geometrical features, the entire colonic lumen must be delineated first. A critical step to obtain a cleansed colonic lumen relies on bowel preparation. The authors have been developing an electronic colon-cleansing technology which minimizes the difficulties associated with the bowel preparation using low-residue diet and contrast solutions, and removes the tagged colonic materials electronically from the abdominal image by image-segmentation methods. In this work, the authors focused on the model description and method evaluation using volunteer studies. Both subjective and objective criteria were employed in the evaluation. The objective criteria measure whether the electronic cleansing results could meet the requirements of the detection model of geometrical features, while the subjective criteria evaluate whether the entire colonic lumen could be obtained. The results showed that the electronic cleansing technology could extract a clean colonic lumen if the volunteer follows the bowel preparation instructions. The objective validation demonstrated that the error due to partial volume effect can be minimized to a low level and the segmentation method showed a high reproducibility and repeatability.

In this paper, a novel simulator integrated with a complete strategy for the cooperation of the catheter and the guidewire is proposed. A composite model of the physically based catheter and the guidewire, which are mapped to distinguished visual model and collision model of these two devices, is constructed at the initial point in the aorta vessels. Once it comes into the neurovascular cavity, the composite model is decomposed to two physically based model corresponding to the catheter and the guidewire respectively. Thereafter, the guidewire is operated and propelled through the catheter, which is fixed in position. The results show that the composite model exhibits equivalent efficiency and effectiveness as well as the separate catheter model, especially at the bifurcation of the vessels.

Local preprocessing is a must in these systems to reduce errors and interferences and cope with the large amount of data from the sensor. This paper presents a circuitry based on a FPGA to implement the interface to the tactile sensor.

The system-in package (SiP) becomes a promising solution to satisfy those requirements. Not only the SiP has a smaller form factor, but also it provides improved signal integrity because the shorter channel length can be achieved. The decreased distance between the logic chips and the memories lower the insertion loss, the crosstalk level, and therefore the signal degradation can be minimized. However, a high level of the system integration in the SiP and the high computing performance can result in a poor thermal management. The high computing performance requires increasing the transistor densities in various IPs, and the switching speeds of the transistors. This leads to increased power consumptions, which cause large thermal dissipations. The thermal dissipations in the package aggravate transistor performance, which yields an overall performance degradation or system malfunctions. Using heat spreader or high thermal conductive material can mitigate the thermal issues, but they are insufficient solutions. In order to improve the thermal management in the SiP, a novel SiP structure is introduced. The proposed SiP has thermal dissipation paths, which is called thermal chimney, from logic/memory dies to the heat spreader. The thermal chimney is high thermal conductive material, and it establishes a direct channel for heat flowing from the chip to the heat spreader to reduce the temperature in the package. In this study, the thermally efficient SiP geometry, how it cools down the package temperature and the manufacturing process will be described. The electrical and thermal performance will be analyzed when assuming the SiP consists of modems and DRAM memories.","2151-1233","978-1-7281-2432-2","10.1109/EDAPS47854.2019.9011675","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9011675","AI;5G;SiP;signal integrity;power integrity;thermal management","Electromagnetic compatibility;Electronic packaging thermal management;Thermal conductivity;Random access memory;Thermal management;Heating systems;Silicon","cooling;crosstalk;DRAM chips;logic circuits;power consumption;system-in-package;thermal analysis;thermal conductivity;thermal management (packaging)","thermal management;transistor switching speed;transistor densities;power consumptions;logic-memory dies;package temperature;manufacturing process;electrical performance;DRAM memories;modems;signal degradation;insertion loss;logic chips;system-in package;virtual reality;artificial intelligence;thermally efficient SiP;electrical co-analysis;thermal performance;thermally efficient SiP geometry;thermal chimney;thermal dissipation paths;high thermal conductive material;heat spreader;performance degradation;package aggravate transistor performance;high computing performance;system integration;crosstalk level;improved signal integrity;high-speed data transmissions;5G mobile communication;high performance applications;thermal co-analysis;SiP","","2","","5","IEEE","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, new communication systems allow a more natural assimilation of information: three-dimensional representations of immersive virtual worlds, also known as metaverses. By putting users in a reality reproduction built from IS, all information can be represented in a consistent virtual environment. But turning IS's data in a coherent metaverse is not a trivial process. Depending the IS's structure and the availability of metadata, several virtual worlds, representing several level of details, can be generated. This paper is a contribution to the analysis of the different possibilities to generate metaverses representing the information stored in the IS dedicated to biodiversity.

However, the large number of variations in IoT technologies makes it hard for the developers or software engineers to select the default features in each application because of compatibility issues among devices. In this paper, Software Product Line (SPL) approach is proposed to design and manage the variabilities and commonalities among smart home applications. An embedded feature selection mechanism is proposed to classify the services by selecting the optimal subset feature. The selected subset features are those that are highly correlated and consistent with other features. The dataset is generated using open smart home simulator (OpenSHS) for daily activities within the virtual environment. The subset of features is evaluated by the level of consistency in each service. Weka data mining tool is used to find the classifier such as Bayes network and decision table which achieve the best accuracies on the dataset obtained in order to support services for residents in smart home applications. The approach adopted is based on a set of predefined performance metrics in order to compare the results for each classifier in terms of its ability to classify the services.

We present a VTL protocol that is verified to be fail-safe using model checking as a verification approach. Performance evaluation through simulation showed that the verified fail-safe VTL protocol delivers-although far from optimum-decent results with respect to such traffic efficiency metrics like throughput and travel time. The investigated efficiency optimization substantially improved efficiency, yet compromised the safety of VTL. We quantify the tradeoff between efficiency and safety and show that increasing the safety level deteriorates efficiency only marginally. In particular, a safety level increase by a factor of 1,000 increases travel time by approximately 2% in the studied scenario.

This is because AR provides seamless interaction between real and virtual environments, the ability to enhance reality, the presence of spatial cues for face-to-face and remote collaboration, support of a tangible interface metaphor, the ability to transition smoothly between reality and virtuality. In addition, the collaborative AR makes multi-user in urban simulation to share simultaneously a real world and virtual world. The fusion between real and virtual world, existed in AR environment by see-through HMDs, achieves higher interactivity as a key features of collaborative AR. In real-time, precise registration between both worlds and multi-user are crucial for the collaborations.

XR systems process streams of data from device sensors, and provide functionalities including perceptions and graphics required by the applications. These processing steps are computationally intensive, and the challenge is that they must be performed within the strict latency requirements of XR. This poses limitations on the possible XR experiences that can be supported on mobile devices with limited computing resources. In this XR context, edge computing is an effective approach to address this problem for mobile users. The edge is located closer to the end users and enables processing and storing data near them.

Besides, DIP utilizes a new dynamic routing table to reduce the growing storage and processing overhead caused by large FIB, which can largely increase the network performance. We developed a prototype of DIP and applied the system on an experimental network. The evaluation result shows superior low latency performance and excellent scalability, which implies a favorable application foreground of DIP.","","978-1-5386-5979-3","10.1109/INFCOMW.2018.8406864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406864","","Electronics packaging;Quality of service;Scalability;Servers;Routing;Buildings;Conferences","Internet;IP networks;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;virtual reality","QoS;Internet;in-band resource reservation;quality of service;tactile network;online virtual reality","","","","4","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome these problems, we have proposed, BCINet, a novel optimized convolution neural network model. We have evaluated the BCINet over two EEG based BCI datasets collected in mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) settings. BCINet significantly outperforms the classification for two datasets with up to 20% increase in accuracy while fewer than 75% trainable parameters.

At present, VRT has broad application prospects in the medical field, especially in psychotherapy. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder. Usually, it is a condition of persistent mental and emotional stress occurring as a result of injury or severe psychological shock. Positive intervention and induction are the key to treatment and prevention of PTSD. As one of cognitive-behavioural therapy, exposure therapy (ET) is the most common and effective psychotherapy for PTSD. However, such traditional psychotherapy is difficult to meet the needs of modern treatment, and the application of VRT--virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), has become an emerging treatment method for PTSD, showing a real, controllable and acceptable unique advantages.

Our main goal is to develop a multi contact-point haptic interface that does not restrict the arm mobility and therefore increases the operational workspace. We propose a simplified kinematic model of the human arm using a notation coming from the robotics field. To figure out the best kinematic architecture we employed real movement data, measured from a human subject, and integrated them with the kinematic model of the exoskeleton.

Not only can this system simulate the underwater performance of glider in a virtual environment, but also it can accomplish the interaction between entity and virtual node using three-dimensional technical display. The semi-physical motion simulation system is used to simulate the behaviors and motions of glider in order to test the software, hardware, data interface and reliability of the glider without launching it into waters. Finally, comparative trials in virtual environment and underwater environment are performed respectively. The result shows that the simulation system can simulate the underwater exploration process of glider satisfactorily with error of maximum depth being less than 2m when maximum depth is set as 120m, and the mathematical models along with simulation algorithm can meet requirement of real-time, therefore successfully proved to be feasible and referential for the design of underwater buoyancy-driven glider.","","978-1-4673-9724-7","10.1109/OCEANSAP.2016.7485580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485580","buoyancy-driven;glider;semi-physical;simulation;three-dimensional technical display","Mathematical model;Software;Computational modeling;Bladder;Three-dimensional displays;Data models;Batteries","autonomous underwater vehicles;digital simulation;hydrodynamics;mechanical engineering computing;user interfaces;vehicle dynamics;virtual reality","semiphysical motion simulation system;buoyancy-driven underwater glider;multifunctionality;underwater performance;virtual environment;virtual node;three-dimensional technical display;data interface","","1","","7","IEEE","9 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This entails individual and dynamic requirements regarding scalability, availability, latency or throughput from the underlying IT infrastructure. To meet those, telecommunication and network providers started a transformation process towards virtualized technologies like network function virtualization (NFV). However, this drastically increases the infrastructure complexity to a point where more autonomous management is required. In order to meet the reliability of dedicated hardware, virtualized solutions are in demand of autonomous recovery and remediation systems. For critical network systems, actions must be selected very cautiously to not disrupt the operational process. To enable a precise handling, anomaly situations need to be accurately identified based on monitoring data streams. Therefore, we present a supervised machine learning method for an online classification of anomaly states based on similarities between anomaly type-specific density grid patterns. For evaluation, we created an extensive NFV testbed running a virtual implementation of the IP multimedia subsystem. Applying our method to classify various synthetically injected anomaly situations, the results reveal an average overall accuracy of 0.94. Further results also show that the classification model is applicable for identifying previously unknown anomaly situations.

This scrutiny empowers researchers and decision makers to better understand, not only the behavior of the system, but also the potential trade-space that could be exploited for innovation. A high-risk production operation, characterized by high cost and high value products, encourages process stability and deters innovation. Operators maintain the working status-quo unless positive outcomes can be realized with a high degree of certainty. Iterative DOE provides the capability to develop that desired certainty, while mitigating the requirements of a high-risk production pipeline.

However, performing dynamic SLAM solely with monocular images remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of asso-ciating dynamic features and estimating their positions. In this paper, we present MOTSLAM, a dynamic visual SLAM system with the monocular configuration that tracks both poses and bounding boxes of dynamic objects. MOTSLAM first performs multiple object tracking (MOT) with associated both 2D and 3D bounding box detection to create initial 3D objects. Then, neural-network-based monocular depth estimation is applied to fetch the depth of dynamic features. Finally, camera poses, object poses, and both static, as well as dynamic map points, are jointly optimized using a novel bundle adjustment. Our experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our system has reached best performance on both camera ego-motion and object tracking on monocular dynamic SLAM.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-7927-1","10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9982280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9982280","","Bundle adjustment;Visualization;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Uncertainty;Shape;Estimation;Virtual reality","cameras;image segmentation;image sensors;image sequences;mobile robots;object detection;object tracking;pose estimation;robot vision;SLAM (robots);stereo image processing;tracking;traffic engineering computing;virtual reality","3D bounding box detection;asso-ciating dynamic features;autonomous driving;bounding boxes;dynamic 3D object tracking;dynamic map points;dynamic objects;dynamic SLAM solely;dynamic surroundings;dynamic visual SLAM system;initial 3D objects;monocular configuration;monocular images;MOT-assisted monocular dynamic SLAM;MOTSLAM;multiple object tracking;neural-network-based monocular depth estimation;robustness;satisfactory accuracy;significant capability;single-view depth estimation;static scenes;visual SLAM systems","","","","35","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How do task requirements affect this role assignment? To address this question, we investigated how healthy right-handed participants bimanually manipulated a static or dynamic virtual object using wrist flexion/extension while receiving haptic feedback through the interacting object's torque. On selected trials, the object shook strongly to destabilize the bimanual grip. Our results show that participants reacted to the shaking by increasing their wrist co-contraction. Unlike in previous work, handedness was not the determining factor in choosing which wrist to co-contract to stabilize the object. However, each participant preferred to co-contract one hand over the other, a choice that was consistent for both the static and dynamic objects. While role allocation did not seem to be affected by task requirements, it may have resulted in different motor behaviours as indicated by the changes in the object torque. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the factors that determine the preference in stabilizing with either the dominant or non-dominant hand.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871013","EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/L015846/1,EP/T027746/1,EP/R026092/1); EU(grant numbers:899626); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871013","","Wrist;Torque;Biology;Haptic interfaces;Resource management;Impedance;Task analysis","biomechanics;feedback;haptic interfaces;virtual reality","choosing which wrist;co-contract;static objects;dynamic objects;role allocation;task requirements;object torque;lateralization;impedance control;dynamic versus static bimanual tasks;daily living;bimanual coordination;role assignment;healthy right-handed participants;static object;dynamic virtual object;haptic feedback;interacting object;selected trials;bimanual grip;wrist co-contraction;determining factor","Activities of Daily Living;Electric Impedance;Functional Laterality;Hand;Humans;Psychomotor Performance","","","19","IEEE","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Towards this objective, networks are undergoing a tremendous transformation from the current packet switching models to Software Defined Networking (SDN) architectures, which provide programmability to configure the network. In its simplest variant, one single centralized controller orchestrates the whole SDN infrastructure. However, the fully centralized architecture (one single controller) can become a performance bottleneck, especially in terms of response throughput and flow setup latency. Furthermore, it suffers from massive scalability issues. In this direction, a number of more sophisticated SDN architectures are currently under research. While their theoretical advantages have been thoroughly discussed in the state-of-the-art, a comparative experimental analysis of these architectures is still missing. This study aims at providing such experimental performance comparison. Herein, we put to test a set of SDN architectures ranging from a fully centralized to a completely distributed control plane, comparing them in terms of flow setup latency. Overall results show that completely distributed architectures provide significantly better performance with almost 31% gain in terms of average flow setup latency over the centralized case.","","978-1-5386-9376-6","10.1109/NETSOFT.2019.8806624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8806624","Control Plane;Data Plane;Distributed;Networks","Switches;Computer architecture;Delays;Protocols;Software defined networking;Throughput","computer network management;Internet;packet switching;software defined networking","Tactile Internet paradigm;ultra-low latency requirements;objective networks;SDN infrastructure;fully centralized architecture;completely distributed control plane;completely distributed architectures;SDN architecture;software defined networking architecture;packet switching models;distributed software defined networks;time 1.0 ms to 5.0 ms","","10","","31","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper demonstrates how virtual commissioning can be used to shorten and improve the commissioning phase of new production facilities and thereby ensure the re-ramp-up of production systems in time. Despite high cost and time saving potential, the development of a virtual model and the commissioning in the simulation environment causes a lot of effort.

Cubic spline control points were initially selected using the start, left swing, left stance, right swing, right stance, and end position of the gait cycle. An adaptive algorithm is presented to add control points as required to bring the error, calculated as a percentage of joint range, to within a maximum threshold value.

Previous research shows that manipulating disparity can alleviate some of the discomfort caused by 3D stereo, but it is best to do this locally, around the object the user is gazing at. The main challenge is thus to develop a gaze predictor in the demanding context of real-time, heavily task-oriented applications such as games. Our key observation is that player actions are highly correlated with the present state of a game, encoded by game variables. Based on this, we train a classifier to learn these correlations using an eye-tracker which provides the ground-truth object being looked at. The classifier is used at runtime to predict object category - and thus gaze - during game play, based on the current state of game variables. We use this prediction to propose a dynamic disparity manipulation method, which provides rich and comfortable depth. We evaluate the quality of our gaze predictor numerically and experimentally, showing that it predicts gaze more accurately than previous approaches.

International standards make it mandatory for all companies for installation of fire and heat sensors in their premises and work places from commercial to domestic use building. These sensors are to be installed in large numbers and increase cost based on unit prices of components as well as complex networks. Fire and heating alarm systems are abundantly available in the market as standalone systems. Few may have both features of detecting heat and fire in the same product but the literature on those is very limited. This research was carried out to review the existing similar products in the market as well as design and develop a unique product with both features in the same unit. An exhaustive product design and development process was followed to arrive at concept design alternatives. Features of these alternatives were compared against a set criteria based on customer requirements. A criteria based on international standards and products available in market was made to arrive at required technical specifications of alternatives. Forced choice procedure was used to find weightage of each criteria element. A total of 10 design alternatives were investigated and analyzed against the selected criteria. Finally best two were selected for further studies. A virtual 3D geometric model of the top rank alternative was developed along with anticipated bill of materials. It was expected that making a hybrid of both fire and heat alarm in one unit will substantially reduce the cost of its installation for industrial, commercial and domestic applications.

At the same time, the great potential of deep learning to advance progress on the video compression problem has driven a significant research effort. Because of the high bandwidth requirements of VR, there has also been significant interest in the use of space-variant, foveated compression protocols. We have integrated these techniques to create an end-to-end deep learning video compression framework. A feature of our new compression model is that it dispenses with the need for expensive search-based motion prediction computations by using displaced frame differences. We also implement foveation in our learning based approach, by introducing a Foveation Generator Unit (FGU) that generates foveation masks which direct the allocation of bits, significantly increasing compression efficiency while making it possible to retain an impression of little to no additional visual loss given an appropriate viewing geometry. Our experiment results reveal that our new compression model, which we call the Foveated MOtionless VIdeo Codec (Foveated MOVI-Codec), is able to efficiently compress videos without computing motion, while outperforming foveated version of both H.264 and H.265 on the widely used UVG dataset and on the HEVC Standard Class B Test Sequences.","","978-1-6654-7822-9","10.1109/IVMSP54334.2022.9816221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9816221","video compression;deep learning;foveation;motion","Deep learning;Training;Visualization;Protocols;Computational modeling;Video compression;Resource management","data compression;deep learning (artificial intelligence);video codecs;video coding;virtual reality","Foveated MOVI-Codec;foveation-based deep video compression;foveated compression protocols;end-to-end deep learning video compression framework;Foveation Generator Unit;foveation masks;Foveated MOtionless VIdeo Codec;VR;FGU","","","","17","IEEE","11 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The overall objective and idea of the AMIRE project is to define and implement a software system that allows content experts to easily design and implement mixed reality applications without detailed knowledge about the underlying base technologies of MR. Therefore, it describes a generic framework that allows an easy communication between the objects (MR components) used in the AMIRE applications. The AMIRE framework uses a component oriented technology and consists of a the minimal set of components required for a demonstrator, a reusable GEM collection and a visual authoring tool for building MR applications. For the realization of the AMIRE framework we also require an object tracking system that is cheap and easy to use. These are features of the ARToolkit library. Most of the current MR applications focus on the development of AR base technologies, like a lot of projects in the area of research and development of AR and MR applications. Many European projects mainly focus on the development of MR applications for a special domain (e.g. technical maintenance), such as ARVIKA, STAR, etc. But none of these projects focused on a structured authoring approach with reusable components and Gems. Due to the complexity of MR/AR applications only MR experts are able to develop MR/AR applications and prototyping of MR based applications becomes a very difficult task, because most research institutes have to develop (these applications from scratch.","","0-7803-7680-3","10.1109/ART.2002.1107008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1107008","","Virtual reality;Production;Application software;Software systems;Libraries;Research and development;Prototypes;Runtime;Programming profession;Licenses","authoring systems;augmented reality;software tools","training demonstrator;mixed reality;AMIRE project;software system;GEM collection;object tracking system;AR base technologies;generic framework;component oriented technology","","19","","","IEEE","6 Jan 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The mismatch has similar characteristics as robot calibration in industrial settings. Nevertheless, any methods for correcting the mismatch need to meet certain computation and accuracy requirements, which are derived from the constraints of a robot-assisted surgical system. On a virtual reality simulator, we use a haptic device (PHANToM Premium 1.5/6DOF) as the hand controller to actuate a robot-assisted surgical tool via neuroArm - a robotic system in microscopic neurosurgery. Within the workspace of the tool, we have defined the computation and accuracy requirements of correction as 1.0 ms and 30.0 μm, respectively. Towards the correction of the pose mismatch, this current work first assesses the suitability of the Newton-Raphson (NR) method for addressing the position mismatch between the haptic interface point (HIP) of the haptic device and the tooltip of the surgical tool. For fast computation, we have modified the NR method to take advantage of its quadratic rate of convergence. This modification adds a feedback loop for selecting appropriate initial values. As well, we have verified the non-singularities of the workspace where the position mismatch needs to be corrected. Assessed in the workspace of 90 targets, the modified NR method achieves an accuracy between the HIP and the tooltip at about 1.0 μm in less than 64 μs - meeting both requirements of correction. Thus, this work confirms the suitability of the modified NR method to efficiently correct the position mismatch between the HIP and the tooltip on neuroArm.","1062-922X","978-1-4799-3840-7","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974193","hand controller;Newton-Raphson method;position mismatch;robot-assisted surgery;virtual reality;neuroArm","Hip;Joints;Haptic interfaces;Vectors;Robot kinematics;Kinematics","end effectors;haptic interfaces;medical robotics;Newton-Raphson method;surgery;virtual reality","position mismatch;haptic device;robot-assisted tool;robot-assisted surgery;orientation mismatch;stylus-style hand controller;end-effector;robot calibration;virtual reality simulator;robot-assisted surgical tool;neuroArm;microscopic neurosurgery;Newton-Raphson method;haptic interface point;feedback loop","","","","24","IEEE","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The performance of an auditory display can be severely compromised if the HRTF measurements are not made individually, for each potential user. This requirement could sharply limit the practical application of auditory display technology. Thus, we have been working to develop a standard set of HRTFs that could be used to synthesize veridical virtual auditory objects for all users. Our latest effort along those lines has involved a feature analysis of HRTFs from 15 listeners who demonstrated high proficiency localizing virtual sources. The primary objectives were to quantify the differences among HRTFs, to identify listeners with similar and different HRTFs, and to test the localizability of virtual sources synthesized from the HRTFs of an individual with closely and not closely matched HRTFs. We used a multidimensional scaling algorithm, a statistical procedure which assesses the similarity of a set of objects and/or individuals, to analyze the HRTFs of the 15 listeners. Listeners with similar HRTFs were identified and their ability to localize virtual sources synthesized from the HRTFs of a ""similar"" listener was evaluated. All listeners were able to localize accurately. When these same listeners were tested with virtual sources synthesized from HRTFs that were identified to be ""different"" by the MDS analysis. Both azimuth and elevation of virtual sources were judged less accurately. Although we were able to identify ""typical"" listeners from the MDS analysis, our preliminary data suggest that several alternative sets of HRTFs may be necessary to produce a usable auditory display system.<>","","0-7803-2078-6","10.1109/ASPAA.1993.379987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=379987","","Multidimensional systems;Auditory displays;Testing;Multidimensional signal processing;Anthropometry;Humans;Transfer functions;Standards development;Signal processing algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis","hearing;display instrumentation;virtual reality;acoustic signal processing;transfer functions","multidimensional scaling analysis;head-related transfer functions;auditory object;virtual auditory display;signal processing;eardrum;virtual sources;multidimensional scaling algorithm;statistical procedure;auditory display system","","8","3","4","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Concurrent with the increase in their popularity, the rise of Big Data has resulted in increased computational requirements and processing power. To meet the requirements of real-time learning and classification, the process of finding the maximum value proves to be the performance bottleneck, and therefore needs to be accelerated. To the best of our knowledge, most studies reported in the literature cannot satisfy the requirements of low latency, high resolution, and low power consumption simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a Voltage-Racing Winner-Take-All (VR-WTA) circuit for acceleration of real-time learning engine. The linear delay elements transform multiple bits into different current racing speeds, and the fastest winner is detected by a sense-amplifying detector. The resolutions are scalable and reconfigurable for the needs of different applications.

This paper focuses on the simulation of physics-based virtual testbeds in which simulated robots are made capable of accommodating external forces exerted by the environment on their manipulators. For this, we integrate methods from multi-body dynamics modeling, advanced robotics, and virtual reality to develop a robotics simulation basis that facilitates the employment of compliant robotic manipulations in simulated applications. The validation of this basis in joint space indicates that a physics-based simulation of robots endowed with active physical interaction control can capture and reflect significant effects which characterize the interactive behavior of physical compliant robots.We demonstrate the practical utility of our approach to unlock competitive advantages in fully simulated applications prone to position uncertainty.

Microsoft's Kinect for Windows (KW) is used in conjunction with the WBB to render a virtual environment for patient engagement. While the patient performs tasks in the virtual setting, their progress is monitored and displayed for the user via a graphical user interface (GUI). The anterior/posterior (A/P) maximum excursion range is calculated by identifying the largest range on the y-axis between the plotted CoP positional data. Similarly, the medial/lateral (M/L) maximum excursion range is calculated using the x-axis. Plots depicting a decrease in maximum excursion values in either the A/P or M/L directions are indicative of an improvement in balance.

Robot designers usually begin with the analysis of new actuators and joint designs. This corresponds to a “bottom-up”-strategy in the development of simulation models. For classical fields of application of robotics, e.g. in production plants with a well defined environment this is the approved method, because it allows very detailed insights into the analyzed subsystems. On the other hand, unpredictable effects of the interaction of multiple subsystems may easily be overseen. In particular, nontechnical environments like in moon exploration tasks or in a biological environment like in forestry applications are hard to describe in an analytical way to integrate them into an analytical simulation model. This is why this paper presents the idea and some practical aspects of the development of “Virtual Testbeds”. In a Virtual Testbed, the entire system is simulated as a whole in Virtual Reality - not only small subsystems of a global system. According to the requirements different subsystems are simulated with different levels of detail. In contrast to the classical “bottom-up”-strategy this can be seen as a “top-down”-approach. Therefore the employment of a multi-body dynamics system as a platform for the development of versatile simulation and testing environments is proposed. Using the examples of the evaluation and testing of an extraterrestrial walking exploration robot design and the development of a method for self-localization in forestry, the idea is further deepened. As a special field of attention the integration of a method of soil simulation as a particular requirement of a Virtual Testbed for walking exploration robots is presented.","2153-0866","978-1-4244-6676-4","10.1109/IROS.2010.5651665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5651665","","Solid modeling;Soil;Legged locomotion;Joints;Robot kinematics;Dynamics","actuators;design engineering;forestry;legged locomotion;virtual reality;wood processing","virtual testbeds;mobile robots;global systems;biological environment;forestry;virtual reality;top-down approach;multi-body dynamics system;exploration robot design;self-localization;actuators;joint designs;bottom-up strategy","","8","","20","IEEE","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is both due to the display being positioned close to the eyes of the user and to the super-sampling typically used in VR. Due to the requirements of low latency and large resolutions in VR, remote rendering can be difficult to support at sufficient speeds in this medium.In this paper, we propose a method that can reduce the required resolution of non-panoramic VR images from a codec perspective. Because VR images are viewed close-up from within a headset with specific lenses, there are regions of the images that will remain unseen by the user. This unseen area is referred to as the Hidden-Area Mesh (HAM) and makes up 19% of the screen on the HTC Vive VR headset as one example. By remapping the image in a specific manner, we can cut out the HAM, reduce the resolution by the size of the mesh and thus reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed by encoder and decoder. Results from a prototype remote renderer show that by using the proposed Hidden-Area Mesh Remapping (HAMR), an implementation-dependent speed-up of 10-13% in encoding, 17-18% in decoding and 7-11% in total can be achieved while the negative impact on objective image quality in terms of SSIM and VMAF remains small.","2472-7814","978-1-6654-3589-5","10.1109/QoMEX51781.2021.9465408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465408","","Image quality;Headphones;Image resolution;Codecs;Prototypes;Rendering (computer graphics);Heat-assisted magnetic recording","image resolution;medical image processing;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","unseen area;specific lenses;codec perspective;nonpanoramic VR images;required resolution;sufficient speeds;remote rendering;super-sampling;image resolutions;VR-content;remote VR;codec speed-up;Hidden Area Mesh pixels;objective image quality;implementation-dependent speed-up;Hidden-Area Mesh Remapping;prototype remote renderer show;HAM;specific manner;HTC Vive VR headset","","","","35","IEEE","30 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is primarily due to the ability to compute and cache in close proximity to users. However, most of the traditional MEC architectures are based on proprietary hardware, and its software functions are tightly integrated with the hardware, so they are not flexible to support the changing service requirements of 5G/6G networks. To address this problem, we propose the integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and cloud virtualization techniques, such as containers, with the MEC architecture and the 5G/6G core system. This approach enables flexible management of computing resources and rapid adaptation to critical end-user requirements. The proposed conceptual architecture aims at end-to-end mobility support necessary to ensure service continuity when end-users move from one MEC to another while guaranteeing the necessary service delay. The proposed architecture is verified through simulations in an extended version of Mininet called the Containernet, which highlight the benefits of centralized network intelligence as well as the modularity and portability offered by SDNs and containers. In our future work, we will develop a method for adaptively selecting the optimal service server in a hierarchical computation system under different system load conditions. This method will ensure high-Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning for virtual reality services in 6G networks.","2572-7591","979-8-3503-1085-6","10.1109/CADSM58174.2023.10076524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076524","Multiple Access Edge Computing;Cloud Computing;5G;6G;QoS;SDN","Solid modeling;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Computer architecture;Virtual reality;Containers;Hardware","","","","","","37","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The features of interiors should be invariant to strong appearance change so as to pop-out the salient object as a whole, while the features of boundaries should be selective to slight appearance change to distinguish salient objects and background. To address this selectivity-invariance dilemma, we propose a novel boundary-aware network with successive dilation for image-based SOD. In this network, the feature selectivity at boundaries is enhanced by incorporating a boundary localization stream, while the feature invariance at interiors is guaranteed with a complex interior perception stream. Moreover, a transition compensation stream is adopted to amend the probable failures in transitional regions between interiors and boundaries. In particular, an integrated successive dilation module is proposed to enhance the feature invariance at interiors and transitional regions. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms 16 state-of-the-art methods.","2380-7504","978-1-7281-4803-8","10.1109/ICCV.2019.00390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9011003","","Feature extraction;Streaming media;Task analysis;Kernel;Object detection;Visualization;Saliency detection","object detection","complex interior perception stream;transition compensation stream;feature invariance;boundary-aware salient object detection;object interiors;selectivity-invariance dilemma;image-based SOD;feature selectivity;boundary localization stream","","82","","50","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A high frequency of interruptions and long duration of blockage may degrade the quality of experience. Macrodiversity of base stations (BSs) has been considered a promising solution where the user equipment (UE) can handover to other available BSs, if the current serving BS gets blocked. However, an analytical model to evaluate the system performance of dynamic blockage events in this setting is largely unknown. In this paper, we consider an open park-like scenario and obtain closed-form expressions for the blockage probability, the expected frequency and duration of blockage events using stochastic geometry. Our results indicate that the minimum density of BS that is required to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of AR/VR and other Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) applications is largely driven by blockage events rather than capacity requirements. As an alternative to increasing BS density, placing the BS at a greater height reduces the likelihood of blockage. We present a closed-form expression for the BS density-height trade-off that can be used for network planning.","","978-0-9883045-5-0","10.1109/ITC30.2018.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8493070","Blockage, 5G, mmWave, stochastic geometry, augmented reality, virtual reality, network planning","Analytical models;Quality of service;Stochastic processes;Handover;Geometry;Reliability","cellular radio;channel capacity;diversity reception;millimetre wave communication;mobile radio;probability;quality of experience;quality of service;stochastic processes;telecommunication network planning;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic","millimeter wave blockage;millimeter wave communication systems;mobile blockers;user equipment;dynamic blockage events;open park-like scenario;closed-form expression;blockage probability;capacity requirements;service requirements;base station density;ultrareliable low latency communication applications;stochastic geometry;Quality of Service;network planning","","21","","27","","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We discuss an approach where several users work cooperatively on one simulation model. To optimize their work, the users need some guidance. For this we suggest small maps and arrows to guide the user to significant objects (machines). In many production scenarios, objects (forklifts, workers) are moving in an unguided fashion. In actual implementations these paths have to be modeled manually. In spite of taking these efforts, we are presenting an automated approach which is based on the 3D layout of the plant.

In this work, we first evaluate a set of iris recognition algorithms suitable for HMD devices by investigating three well-established handcrafted feature extraction approaches, and to complement it, we also present the analysis using four deep learning models. While taking into consideration the minimalistic hardware requirements of stand-alone HMD, we employ and adapt a recently developed miniature segmentation model (EyeMMS) for segmenting the iris. Further, to account for non-ideal and non-collaborative capture of iris, we define a new iris quality metric that we termed as Iris Mask Ratio (IMR) to quantify the iris recognition performance. Motivated by the performance of iris recognition, we also propose the continuous authentication of users in a non-collaborative capture setting in HMD. Through the experiments on a publicly available OpenEDS dataset, we show that performance with EER = 5% can be achieved using deep learning methods in a general setting, along with high accuracy for continuous user authentication.","2474-9699","978-1-7281-9186-7","10.1109/IJCB48548.2020.9304919","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9304919","","Iris recognition;Resists;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Cameras;Pupils;Authentication","authorisation;biometrics (access control);feature extraction;helmet mounted displays;image recognition;iris recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);virtual reality","recently developed miniature segmentation model;minimalistic hardware requirements;deep learning models;HMD devices;iris recognition algorithms;gaze tracking purposes;internal cameras;Head-Mounted Displays;continuous access control;strict access control;sensitive information;critical information;virtual reality;augmented reality;Head-mounted display;benchmarking Iris recognition;continuous user authentication;noncollaborative capture setting;iris recognition performance;Iris Mask Ratio;iris quality","","9","","50","IEEE","6 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because, mmWave can enable dominant 5G services such as ultra-high definition video streaming and virtual reality, by providing them with their requirements, e.g., high data rate and low latency time. But, mmWave channel dynamically changes, which effects on overall performance of 5G network. Hence, efficient radio resource management schemes are needed in medium access control (MAC) layer to wisely distribute mmWave band resources among user equipment (UEs). In this paper, we design a high performance MAC scheduling scheme by improving standard proportional fairness (SPF) scheduling algorithm. In which, UEs demands are considered besides their channel condition. The proposed demand based proportional fairness (D-PF) scheme firstly gives higher priority to UEs with lower data rates requirements and better channel condition, hence higher UEs satisfaction level can be obtained faster. Then, it prioritizes them only based on their channel qualities if their required rates are achieved. Through simulation, we prove that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional round robin (RR) and SPF algorithms in terms of system throughput, where an increase of more than 300 Mbps can be achieved, with maintaining same fairness between UEs. Meanwhile, D-PF scheme provides better throughput and satisfaction for UEs. For example, it can satisfy 95% of network UEs by providing them with their required rates, while only 61% and 62% of UEs can be satisfied if RR or SPF is used, respectively.","","978-1-6654-9749-7","10.1109/BlackSeaCom54372.2022.9858321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9858321","scheduling;demand based proportional fairness;5G network;millimeter wave","Ultra-high definition video;Solid modeling;Job shop scheduling;5G mobile communication;Virtual reality;Streaming media;Throughput","5G mobile communication;access protocols;broadband networks;millimetre wave communication;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;wireless channels","network UEs;millimeter wave based 5G networks;dominant 5G services;ultra-high definition video;virtual reality;high data rate;low latency time;mmWave channel dynamically changes;efficient radio resource management schemes;medium access control layer;mmWave band resources;high performance MAC scheduling scheme;standard proportional fairness scheduling algorithm;UEs demands;channel condition;proportional fairness scheme;data rates requirements;UEs satisfaction level;channel qualities;D-PF scheme","","1","","17","EU","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, even with well-developed infrastructure-based wireless networks, it is still challenged to realize the goal of communicating in low latency for emerging medical services or entertainments such as virtual reality and augmented reality. In this paper, an enhanced computing architecture is proposed to handle the wireless big data applications by integrating the wireless body area networks (WBANs) and mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, access points in WBANs are located next to the remote radio heads, which are designed to handle the delay sensitive computation tasks, while MEC is assigned to execute tasks with high computation. UEs are divided into local execution and reschedule sets, according to the energy consumption, delay and channel condition requirements. Moreover, a task offloading request algorithm is proposed, tasks are offloaded to AP or MEC based on the latency requirements. Consider the limited computation resources of AP, a task arrangement algorithm is given, tasks with lower priority will be offloaded to MEC to execute. The results demonstrate that UEs with higher computation capacity achieve lower average service time and higher number of successfully executed tasks at the cost of the network lifetime.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060276","WBANs;MEC;UE classification;Task priority","Task analysis;Wireless communication;Energy consumption;Wireless sensor networks;Delays;Cloud computing;Bandwidth","Big Data;body area networks;channel capacity;distributed processing;mobile computing;mobile radio;power consumption;resource allocation;telecommunication power management;wireless channels","energy consumption;remote radio heads;access points;augmented reality;task offloading framework;infrastructure-based wireless networks;task arrangement algorithm;latency requirements;task offloading request algorithm;delay sensitive computation tasks;mobile edge computing;WBAN;wireless big data applications;virtual reality;medical services;low latency wireless services;fifth-generation wireless networks;MEC;wireless body area networks;network lifetime","","2","","20","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the first experiment subjects visually traced wire paths with a head referenced cursor, subjectively rated aspects of viewing, and had their vision tested before and after monocular, biocular, or stereo viewing. Only the viewing difficulty with the biocular display was adversely effected by the visual task. This viewing difficulty is likely due to conflict between looming and stereo disparity cues. A second experiment examined the precision with which operators could manually move ring shaped virtual objects over virtual paths without collision. Accuracy of performance was studied as a function of required precision, path complexity, and system response latency. Results show that high precision tracing is most sensitive to increasing latency. Ring placement with less than 1.8 cm precision will require system latency less than 50 msec before asymptotic performance is found.","1087-8270","0-8186-7843-7","10.1109/VRAIS.1997.583063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=583063","","Computer displays;Rendering (computer graphics);Assembly;Delay;Wire;Computer graphics;Three dimensional displays;Laboratories;Aircraft;Hardware","virtual reality;interactive devices;three-dimensional displays;interactive systems;rendering (computer graphics);human factors","operator interaction;head mounted see through displays;viewing conditions;rendering latency;see through format;computer generated nearby wire like virtual objects;visual requirements;experimental tasks;visually guided manual assembly;aircraft wire harnesses;head referenced cursor;stereo viewing;viewing difficulty;biocular display;stereo disparity cues;ring shaped virtual objects;virtual paths;path complexity;system response latency;high precision tracing;system latency","","26","","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The learning, teaching and assessment student experience has evolved from rather static, content focused, textbook based practices to dynamic, highly interactive and agile approaches. The computer supported cooperative learning techniques and groupware tools of the early 1990s provided the opportunity to enhance communication and collaboration in a learning context. The development of mainstream content management systems supported the creation and use of virtual learning environments in the late 1990s. The customization and personalization of the slearning experience was supported by innovative practices, especially in the field of learning objects in the early 2000s. Emphasis on e-assessment and the role of feedback through voice or video over the Internet Protocol as well as podcasts and the use of other innovative technologies was the next step. Currently the use of social learning networks and associated technologies provide the means for adding value on social networking platforms and investigating their role in future learning platforms. The project team focuses on how to enhance learning, teaching and assessment practices through the use of such technologies. For the past few years emphasis was given on enhancing traditional learning environments by exploiting the benefits of 3D virtual learning environments and more specifically the architectural, interaction and communication freedom provided by virtual worlds. This paper provides an overview of the journey taken from creating a 3D virtual learning environment using the Second Life platform to the development of the Distributed and Collaborative Technologies (DaCT) learning village. The paper discusses several pilot studies that took place over a period of four years, focusing on how learning activities are supported in virtual worlds. Our focus is on how architectural features affect interaction and communication patterns in certain learning settings. The paper explains the process followed for (i) setting up the 3D virtual learning environment, (ii) structuring a scenario, (iii) planning induction and training activities, (iv) conducting research in the form of task observation and collaborative evaluation of the environment, (v) performing certain learning and assessment tasks, (vi) evaluating the learning experience and (vii) monitoring and analyzing communication patterns. The scope of the paper is to share findings from extensive knowledge in conducting 3D virtual learning field studies and their evaluation. Emphasis is given on the interactive features of such approaches and the special requirements of engaging with these methods and associated techniques. Pilot studies discussed in the paper included scenarios involving more than 30 participants placed in four different physical locations interacting through the 3D virtual learning environment.","","978-1-4673-2334-5","10.1109/ITHET.2012.6246065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246065","","Training;Avatars;Second Life;Educational institutions;Monitoring;Collaboration","computer aided instruction;groupware;social networking (online);teaching;virtual reality","information technology proliferation;computer supported cooperative learning techniques;groupware tools;communication enhancement;collaboration enhancement;mainstream content management systems;s-learning experience customization;s-learning experience personalization;learning objects;e-assessment;voice feedback;video feedback;Internet protocol;podcasts;social learning networks;social networking platforms;learning enhancement;teaching enhancement;student assessment practice enhancement;virtual world;second life platform;distributed and collaborative technologies learning village;DaCT learning village;architectural features;interaction patterns;3D virtual learning environment;scenario structuring;induction planning;training activity planning;task observation;collaborative environment evaluation;communication pattern monitoring;communication pattern analysis;interactive features","","5","","6","IEEE","23 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The local frequencies may be manifested as, e.g., flowlike, granular, or oriented patterns. It is necessary to make spectral measurements accurate in both frequency and space, conflicting requirements constrained by a generalized uncertainty relationship. Such spectral measurements can be obtained from multiple wavelet-like channel filters that yield a locus of possible frequency solutions. Thus locus of solutions is maximally localized in both space/frequency if the channel filters are Gabor wavelets. A solution is obtained by imposing stabilizing terms developing naturally from assumptions on the signal. The frequency measurement problem is cast as a regularized extremum problem, leading to an iterative constraint propagation algorithm. As a to an iterative constraint propagation algorithm.

These exoskeletons are driven by distant actuation modules through a cable/sheath transmission mechanism. The exoskeleton for each finger has 4 degrees of freedom (DOF), providing independent control for all finger joints. The joint motion is accomplished by a parallelogram mechanism so that the joints of the device and their corresponding finger joints have the same angular displacement when they rotate. Thanks to this design, the joint angles can be measured by sensors real time and high level motion control is therefore made very simple without the need of complicated kinematics. The paper also discusses important issues when the device is used by different patients, including its adjustable joint range of motion (ROM) and adjustable range of phalanx length (ROPL). Experimentally collected data show that the achieved ROM is close to that of a healthy hand and the ROPL covers the size of a typical hand, satisfying the size need of regular hand rehabilitation. In order to evaluate the performance when it works as a haptic device in active mode, the equivalent moment of inertia (MOI) of the device is calculated. The results prove that the device has low inertia which is critical in order to obtain good backdrivability. Experimental analysis shows that the influence of friction accounts for a large portion of the driving torque and warrants future investigation.","1945-7901","978-1-4244-9862-8","10.1109/ICORR.2011.5975387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5975387","exoskeleton;thumb;index finger;rehabilitation;parallelogram mechanism;active and passive rehabilitation","Joints;Fingers;Exoskeletons;Indexes;Friction;Thumb;Electronics packaging","biomechanics;biomedical equipment;bone;friction;interactive devices;medical control systems;orthopaedics;patient rehabilitation","iHandRehab;Interactive Hand Exoskeleton;interactive exoskeleton device;hand rehabilitation;passive rehabilitation motions;active rehabilitation motions;thumb;index finger;cable-sheath transmission mechanism;finger joints;joint motion;sensors;high level motion control;phalanx length;haptic device;equivalent moment-of-inertia;friction","Biomechanics;Equipment Design;Finger Joint;Fingers;Hand;Humans;Range of Motion, Articular;Robotics;Robotics;Thumb","15","","26","IEEE","11 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In specific cases, the RTP-GA architecture presents a complexity that is better than A* algorithm.","2159-6662","978-0-7695-4648-3","10.1109/SBGAMES.2011.23","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363236","pathfinding;genetic algorithm;dynamic environment","Biological cells;Genetic algorithms;Linear programming;Heuristic algorithms;Real-time systems;Games;Vectors","computer games;genetic algorithms;real-time systems;virtual reality","video games;virtual reality environments;obstacle pattern detection;dynamic environments;real time path finding with genetic algorithm;RTP-GA","","2","","9","IEEE","29 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The actuation system is often identified as a focus of this design blending process. This work considers the design, construction and testing of a light weight comfortable high power 7 degree of freedom force feedback exoskeleton.

The precondition for the breakthrough of virtual training is that it overcomes the problems of former approaches. The paper presents the design approach taken during the development of a game-based, virtual training system for procedural assembly knowledge in the EU-FP7 project VISTRA. One key challenge to address when developing virtual assembly training is the extensive authoring effort for setting up virtual environments. Although knowledge from the product and manufacturing design is available and could be used for virtual training, a concept for integration of this data is still missing. This paper presents the design of a platform which transfers available enterprise data into a unified model for virtual training and thus enables virtual training of workers at the assembly line before the physical prototypes exist. The data requirements and constraints stemming from industrial partners involved in the project will be discussed. A second hurdle for virtual training is the insufficient user integration and acceptance. In this context, the paper introduces an innovative hardware set-up for game-based user interaction, which has been chosen to enhance user involvement and acceptance of virtual training.","","978-1-4673-2563-9","10.1109/VSMM.2012.6365944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6365944","Data Integration;Industrial Training;PLM;User-Interaction;Virtual Reality","Training;Assembly;Data models;Solid modeling;Hardware;Production;Geometry","assembling;automobile industry;business data processing;computer based training;data integration;human factors;product design;virtual manufacturing;virtual reality","automotive industry;virtual assembly training systems;game-based virtual training system;procedural assembly knowledge;EU-FP7 project;VISTRA;virtual environments;manufacturing design;product design;data integration;enterprise data;unified model;assembly line;user integration;game-based user interaction;user involvement;user acceptance","","32","","12","IEEE","3 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the emergence of Metaverse applications, where users consume multimedia experiences that result from the real-time combination of distributed live sources and stored digital assets, has changed the requirements for, and possibilities of, systems that provide distributed caching, computation, and communication. We argue that the real-time interactive nature and high demands on data storage, streaming rates, and processing power of Metaverse applications will accelerate the merging of the cloud into the network, leading to highly-distributed tightly-integrated compute- and data-intensive networks becoming universal compute platforms for next-generation digital experiences. In this paper, we first describe the requirements of Metaverse applications and associated supporting infrastructure, including relevant use cases. We then outline a comprehensive cloud network flow mathematical framework, designed for the end-to-end optimization and control of such systems, and show numerical results illustrating its promising role for the efficient operation of Metaverse-ready networks.","","978-1-6654-6763-6","10.1109/6GNet54646.2022.9830429","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9830429","Metaverse;virtual reality;augmented reality;immersive video;edge computing;caching;distributed cloud;decentralized control;5G networks","6G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Multi-access edge computing;Metaverse;Merging;Streaming media;Real-time systems","cloud computing;mobile computing;storage management;virtual reality","end users;end-to-end compute-communication process;metaverse applications;real-time combination;distributed live sources;real-time interactive nature;data storage;tightly-integrated compute;data-intensive networks;universal compute platforms;next-generation digital experiences;comprehensive cloud network flow mathematical framework;end-to-end optimization;cloud computing;distributed computing;mobile edge computing;metaverse-ready networks;predetermined computation nodes","","17","","27","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The critical point is to provide a consistent view of the world to all participants. Classical client-server approaches work well for a limited number of users on a local network, but fail when trying to support large scale shared virtual worlds with a large number of users on an open network with uncontrolled resources like the Internet. The paper presents the Continuum platform which aims to offer a software oriented framework for 3D shared worlds, based on a shared object replication model and a set of interfaces describing services.

"Resource allocation in buffered crossbar switches for supporting network virtualization","Qiang Duan","Information Science and Technology Department, Pennsylvania State University, Abington, USA","2010 International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing","20 Sep 2010","2010","","","147","152","Network virtualization has been proposed as a diversifying attribute of the future inter-networking paradigm. By allowing multiple heterogeneous network architectures to cohabit on a shared physical substrate, network virtualization provides flexibility, promotes diversity, and promises increased manageability. One of the most fundamental issues in network virtualization is to support multiple virtual networks in the packet switches that constitute the underlying network infrastructures. A key challenge to supporting network virtualization in switches lies in resource allocation for meeting the performance requirements of different virtual networks. Buffered crossbar is becoming one of the dominating switch architectures widely deployed in network infrastructures. Therefore, how to support network virtualization in buffered crossbar switches becomes a significant research problem. The research study presented in this paper addresses the problem of resource allocation in buffered crossbar switches for supporting network virtualization. The main contributions of this paper include an analytical model for traffic control in buffered crossbar switches to support network virtualization and the analysis techniques for allocating resources, including processing capacity and buffer space, in the switch for supporting the performance requirements of various virtual networks. The modeling and analysis techniques developed in this paper are general and flexible; thus are applicable to support heterogeneous virtual networks in buffered crossbar switches with various packet scheduling schemes.","2325-5560","978-1-4244-6971-0","10.1109/HPSR.2010.5580271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580271","","Delay;Bandwidth;Servers;Analytical models;Resource management;Switches","computer network management;internetworking;performance evaluation;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic;virtual reality","resource allocation;buffered crossbar switches;supporting network virtualization;internetworking;multiple heterogeneous network architectures;multiple virtual networks;packet switches;network infrastructures;performance requirements;virtual networks;switch architectures;traffic control;buffer space","","2","","15","IEEE","20 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The developed image stabilization system can be used for an advanced wearable telepresence system. Requirements of an image stabilization system, which can be used as a wearable system, are compactness, lightness in weight, and real time process such as 30 frames/s. We have implemented our image stabilization system to satisfy these requirements.

In particular, 3GPP 5G standards adopt a flow-based 5G Quality-of-Service (QoS) framework that allows more flexibility in mapping QoS ""flows"" to data radio bearers. Nonetheless, the 5G QoS classes are pre-defined and QoS treatment is limited to the ""flow"" level. As we will argue in an earlier paper, the 5G QoS framework cannot fully and intelligently utilize the diversity of 5G radio bands and other capabilities to cope with fast varying channel conditions, and is therefore inadequate in meeting the quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements of many emerging applications such as augmented/virtual realities (AR/VR) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV). This has led us to advance a novel software-defined, fine-grained QoS framework for 5G/NextG networks.In this ""work in progress"" paper, we share our initial experience in prototyping the proposed fine-grained QoS framework. Our framework extends both the 5G core network and 5G radio access network (RAN) functionality to enable intelligent control of radio resources in a fashion that exploits application semantics to improve user QoE.

To meet the ever-growing resource demands of these SLAM algorithms, the localization task can be offloaded to edge cloud platforms. Although pose calculation techniques are optimized for resource-limited robotic environments, the volatile nature of cloud platforms with the strict requirements of realtime AR applications can still lead to deteriorated performance. In this paper, we propose an LSTM-driven overload control mechanism that can effectively improve the worst-case response time of an edge-assisted SLAM by predicting overloaded periods in advance. Our main contribution is threefold. First, we identify factors influencing the response time of edge-assisted SLAMs fed by real-time AR applications and propose two applicable control actions. Second, we present our control architecture including an encoder-decoder LSTM model that can forecast response time degradation by using a specific image quality metric. Third, we demonstrate the applicability and performance of our proposed control methods along with their effects on the pose accuracy by performing dedicated experiments with challenging motion patterns and the widely-known EuRoC benchmarking dataset.","","978-1-6654-3225-2","10.1109/AIVR52153.2021.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9644248","AR;MR;SLAM;Edge Computing;LSTM","Location awareness;Cloud computing;Solid modeling;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Three-dimensional displays;Robot kinematics;Virtual reality","cloud computing;mobile robots;position control;real-time systems;rendering (computer graphics);robot vision;SLAM (robots)","overloaded periods;edge-assisted SLAM;real-time AR applications;applicable control actions;control architecture;encoder-decoder LSTM model;response time degradation;control methods;pose accuracy;Localization delay;cloud-assisted;applications via LSTM-driven overload control;3D coordinate system;rendered digital objects;resource demands;SLAM algorithms;localization task;cloud platforms;pose calculation techniques;resource-limited robotic environments;volatile nature;realtime AR applications;deteriorated performance;LSTM-driven overload control mechanism;worst-case response time","","","","46","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For most of these scenarios, accurate object alignment constitutes a requirement to ensure the desired outcome. This task has proved to be especially challenging in egocentric approaches, frequently leading to estimation errors in depth. While traditional MR methods provide virtual guides such as text, arrows, or animations to assist users during alignment, this work explores the feasibility of using additional views generated by virtual cameras and mirrors. Presenting additional views from different perspectives can help to mitigate the estimation errors and show information that is not directly visible to users.To explore the benefits of using additional views for alignment tasks, and to collect reliable data and diminish external factors, we conducted a user study in a controlled virtual environment where participants aligned objects supported by additional views from a top-down camera and virtual mirrors. Data regarding alignment error, time to completion, user's interaction and attention, distance traveled, average head velocity, usability, and mental effort were collected.

In this work, we propose an optimal transmission strategy for virtual reality applications able to fulfill the bandwidth requirements, while optimizing the end-user quality experienced in the navigation. In further detail, we consider a tile-based coded content for adaptive streaming systems, and we propose a navigation-aware transmission strategy at the clientside (i.e., adaptation logic), which is able to optimize the rate at which each tile is downloaded. First, we introduce the viewport- quality as metric that reflects the quality of any portion of the sphere displayed by the end-user.

Recently, two MPEG PC coding standards have been developed to address the relevant application requirements and further developments are expected in the future. In this context, the assessment of PC quality, notably for decoded PCs, is critical and asks for the design of efficient objective PC quality metrics. In this paper, a novel point-to-distribution metric is proposed for PC quality assessment considering both the geometry and texture. This new quality metric exploits the scale-invariance property of the Mahalanobis distance to assess first the geometry and color point-to-distribution distortions, which are after fused to obtain a joint geometry and color quality metric.

Heterogeneous NVEs (i.e., with different equipment and technologies) are difficult to manage due to the lack of standardized management solutions. As a first step to achieve management interoperability, good performance, and high scalability, we implemented, evaluated, and compared four management interfaces for physical routers that host virtual ones. The interfaces are based on SNMP (v2c and v3), NETCONF, and RESTful Web Services, and are designed to perform three basic VR management operations: VR creation, VR retrieval, and VR removal. We evaluate these interfaces with regard to the following metrics: response time, CPU time, memory consumption, and network usage. Results show that the SNMPv2c interface is the most suitable one for small NVEs without strict security requirements and NETCONF is the best choice to compose a management interface to be deployed in more realistic scenarios, where security and scalability are major concerns.","1573-0077","978-1-4799-8241-7","10.1109/INM.2015.7140284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140284","","Virtualization;Servers;Data models;Protocols;Virtual machine monitors;Memory management;XML","open systems;security of data;virtualisation;Web services","NETCONF;RESTful Web services;router virtualization management;network virtualization environments;NVEs;virtual networks;VN provisioning;virtual routers;management interoperability;VR management operations;VR creation;VR retrieval;VR removal;SNMPv2c interface;security","","6","1","42","IEEE","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The resulting throughput and latency gains are likely to bring Wi-Fi one step closer to supporting emerging real-time applications like augmented and virtual reality. While throughput gains resulting from the use of MLA are mostly linear, the latency gains exhibit interesting characteristics and are the subject of this paper. We use our in-house simulator to study the latency enhancements resulting from MLA and seek to answer whether Wi-Fi 7 devices can meet the challenging latency requirements demanded by most real-time applications. In this pursuit, we observe that allowing Wi-Fi devices to contend on even a single additional link without changing any physical layer parameters can lead to an order of magnitude improvement in the worst-case latency in many scenarios.

The agent communication languages proven successful in software based multi-agent systems incur overheads that make them impractical or infeasible for the transfer of low-level data. Instead, real world systems typically employ application specific protocols to transfer video, audio, sensory, or telemetry data. These protocols lack the transparency and portability of formal agent communication languages and consequently are limited in their scalability.

Firstly, we convert the video initial position's texture coordinates to angle values, and compute turning degree according to the actual click position in the scene, and then, camera view roams to video's initial position. Secondly, the display content switches to the video player smoothly. During the video is playing, the camera view rotates to the video's end position. Finally, the content switches back to the panoramas after the video is over, and we make sure that the end video frame matches with the current perspective view. Experiments show that this method has fluency and a strong sense of reality.

VRE separates the development process into two steps: first, the application is described in a hardware-independent way using the VRE programming language, and then the implementation is done (to a great part) automatically by the VRE code generator system. As the hardware underlying SDR requires parallel architectures of different kinds to achieve the required high performance within a low power consumption budget, hardware-specific requirements are excluded from the VRE program. Instead, a separate hardware description file supplements the program. Therefore, the application can be described without any prior knowledge of the target hardware, and the same program can be implemented on different parallel hardware platforms. This paper concentrates on the VRE programming language and the graphic representation of VRE programs using Simulink. Special emphasis is given to the representation of different types of control flow.","2162-3570","0-7803-9333-3","10.1109/SIPS.2005.1579835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1579835","","Hardware;Application software;Optimal scheduling;Filters;Program processors;Computer languages;Engines;Software radio;Signal processing;Parallel architectures","software radio;parallel languages;digital simulation;telecommunication computing;virtual reality","system level hardware abstraction;virtual radio engine;software defined radio;programming language;graphic representation;Simulink","","2","","13","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Virtual Worlds like Second Life are emerging to be a main stream server workload because of their popularity due to richness of 3D content and immersive social experience they can provide. So, it is very important for computer architects to fully understand this workload and its requirements. In this paper, our goal is to fully analyze the performance and to characterize the processing of Second Life server Simulator process. The simulator process has three key critical functions that dominate the performance characteristics of this workload. These are: 1) Physics engine that is responsible for simulating real world behaviors taking into account mass of the objects, gravity, wind force, etc., 2) Scripting engine that is responsible for executing scripts attached to the objects. Scripts is the main way of manipulating object behaviors (motion, color, etc.) in-world on the server, and 3) Simulator logic that is responsible for simulating the world which includes avatar movement, calculating visible areas and communicating with the clients. Our work includes performance scaling experiments, comparison of performance on Intel's Clovertown and Nehalem processor based server systems and collecting and analyzing architectural characterization data for this workload. Our measurements have shown that Intel's latest Xeon servers using Nehalem processors offer 20 to 50% performance improvement over previous generation processor based system, and that the physics computation is more compute and memory intensive. To get a better perspective of Second Life's requirements, we have compared this workload with three other popular commercial server workloads (TPC-E, SPECjAppServer and SPECjbb) and found out that this workload executes 2 to 10 times more floating point, multiply and divide instructions.","1094-7256","978-1-4244-4921-7","10.1109/HIPC.2009.5433182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5433182","","Second Life;Performance analysis;Computational modeling;Engines;Physics computing;Analytical models;Gravity;Logic;Avatars;Data analysis","network servers;software architecture;software performance evaluation;virtual reality","virtual world implication evaluation;server architecture;Linden lab;3D content richness;second life server simulator process;server workload;physics engine;scripting engine;simulator logic;Intel's clovertown;Nehalem processor;architectural characterization data analysis;Xeon servers","","","","26","IEEE","18 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By dynamically partitioning the VE with Voronoi diagrams and aggregating game states of overloaded nodes onto superpeers, VSM supports existing consistency control to enable scalable, load balanced, and fault tolerant VE state management. As both client and server-side resources are utilized collaboratively, VSM also integrates both client-server and peer-to-peer VE designs in a unified approach.","2331-9860","978-1-4244-1457-4","10.1109/ccnc08.2007.255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4446553","","Peer to peer computing;Avatars;Network servers;Virtual environment;Scalability;Fault tolerance;Proposals;Computer architecture;Engineering management;Computer science","client-server systems;computational geometry;computer games;fault tolerance;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation;virtual reality","Voronoi state management;multiuser virtual environment;peer-to-peer massively multiplayer online game;resource utilization;centralized client-server system;fault tolerance;load balancing","","40","","37","IEEE","1 Feb 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to different data structure needs regarding rendering and simulation tasks, common systems typically focus on one of these areas. In complex technical or mechatronical systems like mobile robotic applications, rendering capabilities are mostly neglected. Hence, the used models are designed with minimal effort resulting in purely functional virtual environments with low visual quality. The novel field of eRobotics is currently being developed as an intuitively applicable eService related to VR in advanced robotic and engineering applications. In this contribution, we will introduce novel system structures and techniques, which meet the requirements to realize a holistic eRobotics development support tool, combining complex simulations with state-of-the art rendering techniques. Semantic world models build the ideal basis in order to combine both areas. Readily available data like provided by geo information services (GIS) can be used as input for the creation of close-to-reality virtual testing environments with minimal effort. Additionally, the close interplay of simulation and rendering modules allows making the transition from a passive render component towards an active one, further improving the accuracy and performance of non-rendering-related tasks like optical sensor simulations.","","978-1-4799-2578-0","10.1109/EMS.2013.123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779935","VR simulation systems;real-time rendering;semantic world modeling;eRobotics","Rendering (computer graphics);Semantics;Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Databases;Data models;Object oriented modeling","control engineering computing;data structures;geographic information systems;mobile robots;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","semantics-based render framework;active render framework;complex erobotics applications;realistic virtual testing environments;multidomain VR simulation systems;data structure;complex technical system;mechatronical system;mobile robotic applications;functional virtual environments;eservice;engineering applications;erobotics development support tool;complex simulations;semantic world models;geo information services;GIS;close-to-reality virtual testing environments;passive render component;nonrendering-related tasks;optical sensor simulations","","6","","21","IEEE","31 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Registering a set of 2D videos with a 3D model can provide an intuitive venue for viewing multiple videos simultaneously. In such a setup, it is likely that the user will want to work with the dynamic 3D environment from a remote location, requiring that videos be transferred over a network to be registered with a 3D model.

The requirements are of two categories, i.e., constructional and functional. The constructional issues consist of the isomorphism, portability, motion range capability, and accommodation for human hand size variability. The functional issues consist of bandwidth compatibility with the human hand (which itself has asymmetric input/output characteristics), proprioceptive (force limit) compatibility, and consideration of the psychometric stability of the human hand in sensing force magnitudes and variations. Also of importance is the sensitivity of the master device that must be more than that of the human hand. In this regard, 14 existing designs of hand masters are evaluated to see how well they satisfy the stated constructional and functional requirements.<>","","0-7803-1363-1","10.1109/VRAIS.1993.380770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=380770","","Manipulator kinematics;Telerobotics;Force control;Output feedback;Computer input/output","manipulator kinematics;telerobotics;force control;feedback;interactive devices","perceptual feedback issues;dexterous telemanipulation;dexterous master devices;teleoperating multifingered robotic hands;finger force feedback;constructional issues;isomorphism;motion range capability;human hand size variability;bandwidth compatibility;human hand;asymmetric input/output characteristics;psychometric stability;force magnitudes;master device;hand masters","","77","33","54","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One prominent problem is insufficient coordination. Coordination problems are more pronounced when participants are distributed across space and time, as in the South African public sector. The complexity associated with the distributed nature of the environment, heterogeneity, autonomy and the increasing need to collaborate, provokes the need to develop a novel coordination support system for the South African public sector. However, for a solution to be successful, certain requirements, motivated from both literature and the environmental scan of the public sector, conducted as a case study, must be adequately addressed. This paper argues that the mechanisms of an awareness based life-cycle model, characterised by virtual community properties from a collaboration perspective, can adequately account for the dynamic aspects of the coordination requirements in a distributed environment. The paper initiates with a brief introduction, succeeded with a review of the objectives and methodology employed. Next, a brief background relative to the requirements to be fulfilled and the desirable characteristics of the addressing model is explained. Thereafter, a discussion on how the model addresses the requirements ensues, followed by a discussion thereof. The paper concludes by highlighting the values, and limits of the artefact, while taking cognisance of subsequent, future work.","","978-1-9058-2451-9","10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2015.7190581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7190581","Collaboration;coordination;Distributed Environment;Public sector;Virtual communities","Collaboration;Communities;Aerodynamics;Complexity theory;Context;Business;Semantics","distributed processing;groupware;public administration;virtual reality","coordination requirements;distributed South African public sector;virtual community-centric collaboration process lifecycle perspective;cooperation;coordination problems;coordination support system;awareness based life-cycle model;virtual community properties;collaboration perspective;distributed environment","","","","16","","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, with the amount of data generated by these applications in edge computing systems, where resources are limited, the question of automated resource allocation is an important issue for the management of these services. Besides, Edge Computing (EC) systems such as Home Edge Computing (HEC) is one of the architectures which makes it possible to meet these expectations thanks to the proximity of its servers to end-users. HEC is a new architecture of edge computing with three levels of server organization (HEC-MEC-Cloud), that allows us to reduce the communication delay. Unfortunately, these HEC servers that are close to the devices are very limited in terms of resources. In addition, with the amount of data generated by users on these home servers and the current resource management system in this HEC architecture, compliance with the requirements, such as the ultra-low latency (between 1 to 10 ms) and the throughput, for these applications become very difficult especially in certain situations where the network is overload by the traffic from users. In this paper, we propose a dynamically automated resource allocation method in the HEC-SDN architecture. This resource allocation proposal allows the HEC architecture to be integrated with Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology to centralize management and control. In addition, we propose a load balancing technique called Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithm for HEC-SDN systems (D-LBAH) which has a positive effect on reducing latency on the communication between end devices. Thus, the simulation results show that D-LBAH effectively reduces latency to 88.91 %, and improves throughput to 28.48% on the HEC-SDN architecture.","","978-1-6654-2574-2","10.1109/FiCloud49777.2021.00051","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP21H03430); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9590407","Multi-controller;HEC;Resource allocation;SDN;Load Balancing","Tactile Internet;Heuristic algorithms;Software algorithms;Computer architecture;Load management;Throughput;Servers","resource allocation;software defined networking","HEC architecture;resource management;ultra-low latency;HEC-SDN architecture;resource allocation;software defined networking;dynamic load balancing;HEC-SDN systems;D-LBAH;augmented reality;virtual reality;Home Edge Computing;server organization;HEC-MEC-Cloud;HEC servers;home servers;dynamically automated resource allocation","","1","","30","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when geographically separated, they can experience difficulty in communicating - as computer-mediated cues are often compromised. Given the heterogeneity of media and myriad of interaction techniques that exist in groupware, supporting inter-referential awareness can be difficult. We present a unified and systematic way of encapsulating the numerous factors related to this form of awareness through the creation of process-driven ontology.

We aimed to identify critical problems and suggest design requirements and solutions. We used user and task analysis methods to learn about practices performed in an operating room by observing surgeons in their working environment to understand how they performed tasks and achieved their intended goals. Drawing on observations and analysis from recorded laparoscopic surgeries, we have identified several constraints and design requirements to propose potential solutions to address the issues. Surgeons operate in a dimly lit environment, surrounded by monitors, and communicate through verbal commands and pointing gestures. Therefore, performing user and task analysis allowed us to understand the existing problems in laparoscopy better while identifying several communication constraints and design requirements, which a solution has to follow to address those problems. Our contributions include identifying design requirements for laparoscopy surgery through a user and task analysis.

The idea is to be able to design AR applications taking advantage of modules offered as services from different developers and using data from different sources. In addition, an increasing number of AR applications is deployed within mobile devices and involve pervasive computing. Thus, a framework aiming to allow developers to create state of the art applications should also offer the built-in ability to develop transparently distributed applications and pervasive services. This paper presents the design of a framework to create AR applications using services and data from different sources in a transparent and efficient way. The goal of the framework is to offer ability to build composite applications combining locally running functionality and remote AR services. This framework is the result of the extension of a previously developed component based framework named ARCS (Augmented Reality Component System).

It is usually a complex task which requires real-time processing and high precision results for adequate user experience. Recently, different deep learning techniques have been proposed to detect objects in 6DoF in RGB images. However, they rely on high complexity networks, requiring a computational power that prevents them from working on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the complexity of 6DoF detection networks while maintaining accuracy. We used Knowledge Distillation to teach portables Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to learn from a real-time 6DoF detection CNN. The proposed method allows real-time applications using only RGB images while decreasing the hardware requirements. We used the LINEMOD dataset to evaluate the proposed method, and the experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the memory requirement by almost 99% in comparison to the original architecture with the cost of reducing half the accuracy in one of the metrics.

For the DVMM, we design and implement the simulation of HPET, which includes HPET structure, HPET initialization, and callback function. GOS detects HPET device when system starting up.

The immersive and interactive experiences are achieved by fusing real-time color plus depth video of physical scenes from multiple stereo cameras, displaying 3D reconstructions of physical and virtual objects, and tracking intersections of objects in a virtual space to facilitate interactions between objects. While tele-immersive (TI) systems have been attracting a lot of attention these days as a possible advancement of the current 2D video-based communication systems and of the virtual reality spaces, the challenges lie in limited resources available to satisfy the many requirements on a usable TI system. One of the TI challenges remains the quality of real-time 3D reconstruction of physical scenes. Our work is motivated by the lack of understanding of the importance of various TI system parameters on the quality which is critical for allocating limited resources to make TI systems useful. This paper investigates the impact of different quality parameters of TI systems on accuracy and speed of task executions in TI environments. We have designed a task of moving a virtual ball from an initial center position to a basketball basket close to top in a closed virtual cuboid space. Successful completion of the task involves localization, orientation and motion coordination for a human in TI environment. We report quantitative and qualitative measurements collected during task executions under simulated variations of 3D reconstruction quality parameters. Based on our experimental results with 29 subjects under 13 quality variations, we concluded that the most important parameter is the frame rate followed by the presence of of a human rendering rather than just an avatar representation of hands.","1944-9410","978-1-4244-5905-6","10.1109/VECIMS.2010.5609356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5609356","","Three dimensional displays;Cameras;Rendering (computer graphics);Image color analysis;Streaming media;Visualization;Humans","image reconstruction;stereo image processing;video signal processing;virtual reality","visual quality parameter;tele-immersive system;2D video-based communication system;virtual reality spaces;3D reconstruction quality parameter;human rendering","","","","14","IEEE","25 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the main goal of the AR service itself is to provide the user the visualized computing experience in their life, the systematic requirements include the real-time performance since the service should be reacting to the user's state which changes dynamically over time. This kind of real-time response is often very hard to achieve on typical edge devices such as mobile phone or AR goggles due to lack of computational power. To overcome this issue, many of the researches suggest server offloading technique which can provide sufficient amount of computational power in exchange of the transmission overhead. The tradeoff relationship between the computational power and transmission overhead makes the control of the offloading procedure important for the overall service quality. In this paper we propose an RL based server-client controlling scheme REINDEAR. REINDEAR is a system that conducts class-wise characteristic analysis from the experience, so that it could control the AR service tradeoff quality adaptively. From the result of the experiments, we showed that our REINDEAR system learns the underlying behavioural patterns of video objects and provides controls that suits each pattern.","2162-1233","978-1-7281-6758-9","10.1109/ICTC49870.2020.9289225","National Research Council of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9289225","Context awareness;Intelligent systems;Edge computing;Object detection;Augmented Reality","Training;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Visualization;Reinforcement learning;Real-time systems;Trajectory","augmented reality;client-server systems;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;virtual reality","real-time response;typical edge devices;mobile phone;computational power;server offloading technique;transmission overhead;offloading procedure;service quality;RL based server-client;AR service;REINDEAR system;REINforcement learning agent;dynamic system control;edge-assisted Augmented Reality service;visualized computing experience;systematic requirements;real-time performance","","2","","10","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing mobile edge computing technology can offload tasks to the edge server for computation through the wireless channel, thereby satisfying the low delay requirement of the applications. However, due to the limited computing resources, a single-edge server cannot satisfy the offloading requirements of all users. Request Aware Task Offloading (RATO) scheme was proposed aiming at the problem that the limited edge server computing resources made it impossible to meet the requirements of task completion delay and device energy consumption with the optimization objective to minimize the weighted total overhead (including the mobile device’s delay performance metric and energy consumption performance metric). Specifically, we first formulated the task offloading and resource allocation problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). After that, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on Deep Q Network was developed to solve the optimal offloading scheme. The simulation results show that the weighted total overhead of the RATODQN is lower than that of the existing schemes by 41.59% on average, thereby effectively improving the user’s QoE.","","979-8-3503-0971-3","10.1109/CBD58033.2022.00059","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Research and Development; Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024584","Mobile edge computing;Task offloading;Resource allocation;Deep reinforcement learning;Dependent tasks","Measurement;Energy consumption;Multi-access edge computing;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Mobile handsets;Delays","cloud computing;face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile computing;resource allocation;virtual reality;wireless channels","Deep Q Network;deep reinforcement learning algorithm;device energy consumption;edge server computing resources;existing mobile edge computing technology;face recognition;low delay requirement;mobile applications;mobile device;offloading requirements;optimal offloading scheme;Request Aware Task Offloading scheme;request-Aware Task Offloading;resource allocation problem;single-edge server;smart mobile devices;task completion delay;virtual reality;weighted total overhead;wireless channel","","","","24","IEEE","25 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As computer and collaboration technologies allow project team members to be increasingly dispersed in time, place, and organizational affiliation, even greater opportunities and challenges arise. This paper explores the issues associated with knowledge management in virtual project teams. The advantage of virtual projects is their flexibility to bring together members from diverse contexts for short-term endeavors. Knowledge, in contrast, is by nature a long-term phenomenon and emerges in stable social and organizational contexts. The paper describes some of the main challenges of bridging these contrasting requirements, especially the transferability of knowledge to and from the project. A typology of projects is presented, along with a framework that focuses on the management of virtual projects in particular. Research questions in the management of virtual projects are presented, and an integrated approach for examining those questions is discussed.","","0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926602","","Knowledge management;Electrical capacitance tomography;Virtual groups;Project management;Collaboration;Tellurium;Ores;Identity-based encryption;Read only memory;Technological innovation","virtual reality;project management;deductive databases;groupware","knowledge management;virtual projects;research agenda;integrated approach","","15","","39","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the design and implementation of a domain-specific language called DIPS (Digital Interactive Performance Sketch) that aims to help directors of such performance test their ideas quickly. On the surface, DIPS provides the common domain abstractions and their associated operations for performance with simple rule syntax that simplifies the task of designers to a large degree. Behind the scenes, DIPS is realized through a combination of a number of established language embedding techniques on the Scala language and some middle-level facility based on the Scala Akka library. To evaluate DIPS, we have implemented a language workbench and an execution engine together with an application called the Future Circus. The preliminary evaluation results are encouraging and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of DIPS.","","978-1-5090-4781-9","10.1109/SOCA.2016.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796005","Interactive Art;Wearable Computing;DSL","Conferences","art;embedded systems;functional languages;music;virtual reality","functional reactive DSL service facility;mixed reality interactive performance art;dancers;virtual characters;music;domain specific language;digital interactive performance sketch;DIPS;domain abstractions;rule syntax;language embedding;Scala language;Scala Akka library;execution engine;future circus","","","","20","IEEE","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Player behavior is described through previously defined action categories for MMORPGs (Trading, Questing, Dungeons, Raiding, and Player versus Player (PvP) Combat) with addition of a new category for text and voice communication within a session. We conduct a player survey and perform measurements on the client side for a group of 104 players of a popular MMORPG - World of Warcraft (WoW), and discover that there are significant patterns in player behavior. Additionally we examine the importance of both voice and textual (chat) communication in MMORPGs, and note that communication makes a significant portion of average player's playtime and that voice communication is used by a large portion of players. We believe that the results of this study may be used for improving the existing and design of new MMORPGs (e.g., building better load balancing algorithms, addition of content that is more interesting for players) with more emphasis on both old and new communication aspects of the game (e.g., inbuilt voice clients, new ways of connecting the players).

Most of todays conventional design review systems require special programming skills for preparation and high-capacity hard- and software for demonstration. Interacting with 3D data sometimes can be complicated. Today we face five major problem fields using design review systems: Interaction with 3D data, navigation in 3D space, controlling design alternatives, design presentation using less extensive hardware, content development without special software and programming skills. Developments also targeting these issues by using different methods are presented e.g. by LANCELLE, SETTGAST and FELLNER (2008). They developed DAVE — Definitely Affordable Virtual Environment at Graz University of Technology. This immersive cage-based system today is used in evaluating the design of the new main railway station in Vienna, Austria. Also SHIRATUDDIN and THABET (2011) utilized the Torque 3D game engine to develop a Virtual Design Review System. Finally DUNSTON et. al. (2011) designed an Immersive Virtual Reality Mock-Up for Design Review of Hospital Patient Rooms. These and other research work was based on standard 3D game engines by using a conventional cave or power wall for presentation and physical immersion. The edddison MRI Design Review System is an easy to use mixed reality interface for design evaluation and presentation. It integrates a wide range of hardware input systems including a special 3D-printed tangible user interface, desktop computers, tablets and touch screens. On the software side it offers plug-ins for standard 3D software including Autodesk Navisworks and Showcase, Unity3D, Trimbles, SketchUp, Web GL and others. The edddison MRI Design Review System enables laymen to create their own interactive 3D content. It is a solution which makes the creation and presentation of interactive 3D applications as simple as preparing a powerpoint presentation. Without any programming skills you can easily manipulate 3D models within standard software applications. Control, change or adapt your design easily and interact with 3D models by natural interfaces and standard handheld devices. Navigate in 3D space using only your tablet computer. Complex buildings can be experienced by means of 2D floor plans and a touchscreen. System requirements are reduced by using standard software applications such as SketchUp or Unity3D. The edddison MRI Design Review System also makes it easy to present different design stages without extensive hard- and software on all common mobile platforms. Actual application areas are Architectural Design, Digital Prototyping, Industrial Simulation, Serious Games and Product Presentation. Currently, the system has two major use-cases: one setup will show the WebGL demo running on an iPad or an Android tablet computer. Using a WebGL/HTML5 cloud solution MRI Design Review System is able to reach the masses. The second demo is a SketchUp file controlled by optical tracking and 3D printed tangible objects also using a touchscreen or a handheld device. The edddison MRI Design Review System extends the range of existing design review systems with an easy-to-use hard- and software. Herein it simplifies the whole design process by an evolutionary, iterative approach, combined with a bunch of user-friendly intuitive interfaces.","","978-1-4799-6184-9","10.1109/ISMAR.2014.6948472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6948472","Easy to use Mixed-Reality Interface (MRI);User-Friendly Virtual Construction Kit;Building Information Modeling (BIM);Digital Prototyping;3D-Visualization;Serious Games;Unity3D;SketchUp;Autodesk Navisworks;Autodesk Showcase;Unity3D;Trimble;SketchUp;Web GL","","","","","1","1","","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, a VR is required to support fast, accurate, and fine-grained voltage changes for efficient processor power management. Such requirements, nonetheless, can be relaxed when a processor consumes low power at runtime. Thus, manufacturers begin to offer some knobs so that a processor can adapt VR's operating parameters to cost-effectively satisfy the requirements with high efficiency. In this paper, we first demonstrate that: (1) VR efficiency heavily depends on load current (i.e., current delivered to a processor) and a VR operating parameter (e.g., the number of active phases) at given voltage; (2) a processor running a parallel application mostly consumes small current due to aggressive power management; and (3) when the processor is in active state, all the phases are always activated in the VR. (2) and (3) in turn lead to poor VR efficiency at most runtime. Second, we present VR-Scale that dynamically scales the number of active phases based on the predicted load current for the next interval. Our evaluations based on an Intel processor running emerging parallel applications show that VR-Scale can reduce the total power consumed by a processor and its VR by more than 19% with negligible performance impact.","","978-1-4673-8729-3","10.1145/2897937.2898109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7544392","","Runtime;Hidden Markov models;Voltage control;Regulators;Markov processes;Filtering;Decision support systems","power aware computing;voltage regulators","VR-scale;runtime dynamic phase scaling;processor voltage regulators;power efficiency improvement;critical platform components;processor power management;VR operating parameter;load current;aggressive power management;Intel processor","","4","","23","","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the requirements of 5G network such as eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broadband), mMTC(massive machine type communications), and URLLC(Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication), more and more various packets are actually appearing on the network, growing need for network management techniques to handle these various packets. Especially, with steep rise of the number of application service having distinct characteristics such as IoT, VR and 4K video, it is obvious that there is a limitation to use previous general-purpose network management techniques for them. Therefore, there is a need for research and development of adaptive networking technology which classify usage and types of network packet. Several existing machine learning algorithms have been used to classify protocols of target packets and it made a good result in previous researches. In contrast, this paper more focuses on the usage and types of packets and verify accuracy and performance by applying clustering algorithm using Deep Autoencoder.

Services are playing the essential role in cloud computing as cloud computing refers to “both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware and systems software in the datacenters that provide those services”. Therefore, service-oriented architecture should play an important role in cloud computing. In addition, one of the characteristics of cloud computing is to make services available on demand. Given a group of services, different demands may involve different set of services and in different order. This is related to services reuse and composition. However, existing methods only solve service composition in a binary manner: Either a solution exists or no solutions at all. In this paper, we propose the concept of virtual services, which physically do not exist, but are conceptually treated in the same way as physical services. Virtual services are useful when traditional service compositions fail. Virtual services can connect the existing physical services and enable the composition process to succeed. The specifications of virtual services will provide valuable information about how to develop real services to meet the requirements of the given demand. In this paper, we present algorithms that can help identify the virtual services in the case of composition failure and provide the specification of virtual services for further analysis and development.","2378-3818","978-1-4244-8199-6","10.1109/SERVICES.2010.125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575563","","Planning;Clouds;Cloud computing;Artificial intelligence;Companies;Inspection;Algorithm design and analysis","software architecture;virtual reality;Web services","virtual service;cloud computing;Internet;systems software;service oriented architecture","","16","","10","IEEE","16 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Leveraging multihomed device network options becomes a viable approach to ease congestion. Multipath TCP (MPTCP) has the ability to utilize multiple networks simultaneously, but its performance can suffer from excessive overhead due to its use of large reordering buffers. In this paper, we propose a unique approach to removing this limitation with a software-defined networking architecture. Using Mininet with Floodlight controllers to manage available paths, we designed a framework that actively manages Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) and/or MPTCP network usage based on network characteristics. Testbed experiments reveal that the start- up buffering delay is decreased by up to 60% or more when using our algorithm in networks with packet loss rates above 2%. These results are favorable even when compared against another modern multipath algorithm that attempts to remedy this issue. Our analysis shows our framework outperforms standard MPTCP in network usage efficiency by up to 50% at packet loss rates above 1%.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254133","","Streaming media;Bandwidth;Monitoring;Bit rate;Protocols;Google;Delays","software defined networking;transport protocols;virtual reality","omnidirectional adaptive bitrate media delivery;MPTCP/QUIC;SDN architecture;omnidirectional streaming requirements;multihomed device network options;multipath TCP;reordering buffers;Floodlight controllers;packet loss rates;modern multipath algorithm;network usage efficiency;virtual reality quality content;Quick UDP Internet Connections;Mininet;MPTCP network usage;start-up buffering delay","","11","","23","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These solutions are predominantly designed under the assumption of traffic demands that are independently generated at network nodes, without any requirement for synchronization among their received services. In this work, we note that many applications, including cloud computing, virtual reality, gaming, autonomous vehicular networks and collaborative design, generate traffic simultaneously at multiple nodes when they arrive, with possibly non-uniform file sizes, whose performance relies on the synchronous completion of the traffic across the network. This calls for the design of new scheduling algorithms that aims to coordinate the service of packets of the same traffic across the network. Towards this end, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm that not only accounts for the heterogeneity of the file size distributions, but also works towards synchronizing the completion time of the same traffic stream across the network. This is achieved by employing two insights that emanate from key motivating examples we develop: (1) the normalization of traffic load with respect to the non-uniform file sizes; and (2) the incorporation of deviation of normalized loads across network nodes that serve synchronized traffic. After establishing the throughput-optimality of our algorithm in general stochastic networks, we perform extensive simulations under various (spanning both wired and wireless) settings to reveal the potential completion time gains that it yields over other throughput-optimal strategies designed under the assumption of independent traffic generation.","","978-3-903176-00-3","10.23919/WIOPT.2018.8362848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362848","","Task analysis;Delays;Synchronization;Scheduling algorithms;Throughput;Stochastic processes;Data centers","cloud computing;optimisation;radio networks;stochastic processes;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;virtual reality","traffic demands;network nodes;synchronization;cloud computing;virtual reality;autonomous vehicular networks;scheduling algorithms;independent traffic generation;stochastic networks","","1","","29","","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulation training, which is becoming more widespread every year, is an educational process in which the student performs manipulations in an environment as close as possible to the real one, using special means-simulators and the necessary equipment. The analysis of simulation training based on the phantom center, which directly affects the level of mastering practical skills of students and residents of the Faculty of Dentistry, is carried out. High-quality simulation training requires not only phantoms, but also the most modern dental instruments, equipment and materials. Along with phantoms, the use of native drugs “preparation” and virtual training should be mandatory in the course of the simulation centers, which will maximize the list of skills being practiced. It is in the conditions of a specially equipped center, and not a department, that the content of training can be directed not only to the development of individual skills, but also to interdisciplinary training, teamwork, development of norms of professional behavior, communication with patients. However, such training should in no way replace any of the stages of training in Russian universities, but only complement real clinical practice, contributing to improving the quality of mastering practical skills.","","978-1-6654-7007-0","10.1109/TELE55498.2022.9801071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9801071","simulation training;practical skills;phantom center","Training;Drugs;Costs;Instruments;Phantoms;Teeth;Dentistry","computer aided instruction;computer based training;dentistry;further education;phantoms;teaching;training;virtual reality","phantoms;virtual training;simulation centers;specially equipped center;interdisciplinary training;preparing dentists;practical activity;training future dentists;training practical skills;educational process;special means-simulators;high-quality simulation training","","","","10","IEEE","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A number of technical infrastructures are currently hosting these environments, however, client multi server (CMS) infrastructures are considered best for their flexibility. Scalability and consistency are basic issues in developing large scale distributed virtual environments (DVEs) that require special attention. The existing mechanisms have major performance issues, and therefore, more sophisticated infrastructures are required to deal with dynamic requirements of the applications. In this paper, we propose a novel joint hierarchical nodes based user management (JoHNUM) infrastructure for the development of scalable and consistent virtual worlds. It is compared with the game middleware, Matrix, for evaluation purposes that has demonstrated better performance over the existing static mechanisms. Simulation results show that JoHNUM achieves lower levels resource management tree (RMT) and increases user interactive experience.

So Standards and regulations impose exposure limits in order to prevent health hazards. The projected system is able to measure and estimate the daily worker exposure to vibration according to the Standard ISO 5349. User identification is performed by a personal memory device storing data and information concerning the worker and his daily activity. Three orthogonal transducers measure the acceleration transmitted to the hand-arm system and a DSP unit has the task to process data in order to estimate the vibration exposure during the working activity. If the law safety limits are overcome, the device shows on display an alert message followed by an acoustic alarm so to force the worker to stop the machine usage. The aim of the proposed system is to provide a prevention tool for assuring safe working conditions.

First, it is the lower layer of the cloud infrastructure which supports the functions of other layers above it. Second, through the cloud infrastructure and utilization of virtualization and distributed computing techniques, resources from server clusters are made available to enhance the data redundancy factor and efficiency for document access. As huge cloud storage facility incurs operating expenses so the question rests upon how to be reasonable and efficiently manage cloud storage, let's say, in a website for shareware download. The authors propose the use of Power-law Distributions and Improved Cubic Spline Interpolation for multi-perspective analysis of shareware download frequency. The tasks include data mining the usage patterns and to build a mathematical model.

With short distance between access points (APs) and user terminals, multiple APs may cooperate as a group to provide the access service for a user. Due to the high energy consumption for accessing to multiple APs, energy harvesting (EH) technology is introduced into UDN. We propose a novel APs grouping and resource allocation scheme to maximize the throughput via jointly optimizing energy and time allocation of downlink (DL) and UL in EH-based UDN. In order to ensure that the user's energy harvested from APs is sufficient to transmit data, we present a probability function with the energy relationship of DL and UL to jointly optimize the EH range and the time allocation. Moreover, the APs are divided into groups based on the EH range obtained by the function. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted to derive the optimal solution of the formulated power allocation problem for the selected APs. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has better performance compared with existing APs grouping schemes.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-9505-6","10.1109/WCNC49053.2021.9417548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417548","ultra dense network;energy harvesting;access points grouping;resource allocation","Geometry;Energy consumption;Energy resources;Simulation;Virtual reality;Throughput;Resource management","cellular radio;energy consumption;energy harvesting;multi-access systems;particle swarm optimisation;probability;resource allocation;telecommunication power management","power allocation problem;time allocation;EH-based UDN;uplink data transmission;virtual reality;ultra dense network;massive connections;access service;energy consumption;energy harvesting technology;resource allocation scheme;EH range;particle swarm optimization algorithm;access point grouping scheme;PSO algorithm;AP grouping schemes","","","","15","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In response to these issues, we propose an XML-based description language, namely Haptic Application Meta Language - HAML. HAML is designed to provide a technology-neutral description of haptic models. It contains ergonomic requirements and specifications for haptic hardware and software interactions. The envisioned goal is to allow for the creation of plug-and-play environments in which a wide array of supported haptic devices can be used in a multitude of virtual environments, with the compatibility issues being handled by automated engines instead of programmatically by the user. As per implementation, MPEG-7 standard has been used to instantiate HAML schema through the use of description schemes (DS).

Due to management complexity, the survivability and reliability aspects are often disregarded by tenants, eventually resulting in heavy losses due to unavailability of services that are hosted on Virtual Infrastructures (VIs). We present an alternative to improve VIs survivability and reliability, which considers the use of replicas and the spreading of virtual resources atop providers, regions, and zones. Replicas are used to achieve a user-defined reliability level while the controlled spreading of VI components decrease the probability of full outages. In addition, our proposal performs a cost-effective allocation. We formulate the VI allocation with survivability and reliability requirements as a Mixed Integer Program (MIP). Following, binary constraints are relaxed to obtain a Linear Program (LP). The LP solution is given as input for the simulated annealing technique, composing the Reliable and Survivable Virtual Infrastructure Allocation (RS-VIA) mechanism.

In particular, while NFV improves flexibility and scalability by softwarizing physical network functions as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), MEC enables to provide delay-sensitive/time-critical services by moving computing facilities to the network edge. However, these new paradigms introduce challenges in terms of latency, availability, and resource allocation. In this paper, we first explore MEC cloud facility location selection and then latency-aware placement of VNFs in different selected locations of NFV enabled MEC cloud facilities in order to meet the ultra-low latency requirements of different applications (e.g., Tactile Internet, virtual reality, and mission-critical applications). Furthermore, we also aim to guarantee the survivability of VNFs and an edge server against failures in resource limited MEC cloud facility due to software bugs, configuration faults, etc. To this end, we formulate the problem of latency-aware and survivable mapping of VNFs in different MEC cloud facilities as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to minimize the overall service provisioning cost, and show that the problem is NP-hard. Owing to the high computational complexity of solving the ILP, we propose a simulated annealing based heuristic algorithm to obtain near-optimal solution in polynomial time. With extensive simulations, we show the effectiveness of our proposed solution in a real-world network topology, which performs close to the optimal solution.","","978-1-6654-2234-5","10.1109/DRCN51631.2021.9477372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9477372","NFV;VNF;MEC;Network latency;Survivability;Closeness centrality;Simulated annealing","Tactile Internet;Cloud computing;Machine learning algorithms;5G mobile communication;Heuristic algorithms;Computational modeling;Simulated annealing","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;computational complexity;distributed processing;integer programming;Internet;linear programming;polynomials;resource allocation;simulated annealing;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network topology;virtualisation","latency-aware mapping;survivable mapping;network edge;NFV;multiaccess edge computing;diverse communication services;heterogeneous service requirements;physical network functions;computing facilities;latency availability;resource allocation;MEC cloud facility location selection;latency-aware placement;different selected locations;ultra-low latency requirements;virtual reality;mission-critical applications;edge server;service provisioning cost;high computational complexity;real-world network topology;virtual network functions;network functions virtualization;delay-sensitive services;time-critical services;Tactile Internet;resource limited MEC cloud facility;software bugs;configuration faults;integer linear programming;NP-hard problem;computational complexity;simulated annealing;heuristic algorithm;polynomial time","","","","32","IEEE","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Augmented reality (AR) can help overcome these issues. How-ever, only an insufficient amount of fundamental research has focused on the design and hardware selection of such AR needle navigation systems. This work contributes to this research area by presenting a user study (n=24) comparing three state-of-the-art navigation concepts displayed by an optical see-through head-mounted display and a stereoscopic projection system. A two-dimensional glyph visualization resulted in higher targeting accuracy but required more needle insertion time. In contrast, punctures guided by a three-dimensional see-through vision concept were less accurate but faster and were favored in a qualitative interview. The third concept, a static representation of the correctly positioned needle, showed too high target errors for clinical accuracy needs. This concept per-formed worse when displayed by the projection system. Besides that, no meaningful differences between the evaluated AR display devices were detected.

With each passing year, people are striving for development and higher fantastic of life. As part of improvement in wireless communication, data rates have been increased with every successive generation of wireless telephony from 384kbps in 2G to 56Mbps in 3G, 1Gbps in 4G and 20 Gbps in 5G. Humans are also looking for multiple other services, such as enhanced high speed mobile broadband, virtual reality, augmented reality, mix reality, automated driving, and next generation Internet of Things (IoT). 5G has been able to take care of all these requirements and provides a lean and ultra-agile design of communication networks. However, taking into account the ever rising demand for new requirements and data dependent human society, it makes sense to move towards the next generation and prepare vision beyond 5G, designing an innovative 6G substrate which will include latest ground-breaking technologies and designs to satisfy new data and connectivity based aspirations of individuals, businesses and societies. Idea of this paper is to provide deep insight into the services, enablers, use cases and technologies of 6G and also motivate researchers to work towards 6G cellular mobile communication network. As a start point gap analysis of 5G is carried out in comparison to 6G, aspirations in relation to data rates, connectivity are taken and a new design is proposed with future use cases. As seen with 5G networks, a technology requires a blend and fusion with other leading technologies of future like 6G will be amalgamated with path breaking technologies like holographic communications, high-precision manufacturing, a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT / IoMT, and the integration of new technologies, such as visible light communication (VLC) or sub-terahertz, in a truly real 3D coverage scenario. Framework proposed for 6G has to be heterogeneous in nature and will be integrating Satellite, terrestrial and aerial radio access points (UAVs) to form a network with responsive cloud functionalities and thus providing services on the go as well as on demand.","","978-1-6654-6643-1","10.1109/ICIPTM54933.2022.9753847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9753847","Military;6G;5Gi;India","6G mobile communication;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;5G mobile communication;Telecommunications;Internet of Things;Artificial intelligence","5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;cellular radio;Internet of Things;next generation networks","human evolution;wireless communication;data rates;wireless telephony;enhanced high speed mobile broadband;virtual reality;augmented reality;mix reality;next generation Internet of Things;lean design;ultra-agile design;communication networks;data dependent human society;innovative 6G substrate;6G cellular mobile communication network;start point gap analysis;holographic communications;high-precision manufacturing;visible light communication;network evolution;3D coverage scenario","","3","","13","IEEE","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A better answer to this problem is digital watermarking. Digital watermarking is a copyright-protection technique that involves obscuring a picture. The suggested work is primarily concerned with the frequency domain, and it employs a discrete cosine transform (DCT) technique to transform the original image (cover image) into the frequency domain to add a watermark. DCT algorithm increases the speed of the process of watermarking the image. The algorithm performs picture decoding, image processing, watermarking, and decoding of the watermarked image, as well as applying a frequency transformation on the host data to embed a watermark. The transform coefficients and possible picture transformations are then modified. Embedding is done at the sender side and extraction is done at the receiver side. This algorithm also supports secure and faster transmission of images to the receiver. In the future, watermarking applications will include secure extensions, and digital watermarks must meet certain requirements such as integrity, robustness, and complexity.","","978-1-6654-6633-2","10.1109/ICRTCST54752.2022.9781929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781929","Digital watermarking;copy right protection;frequency domain;Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT);Embedding;Extraction","Privacy;Frequency-domain analysis;Image processing;Watermarking;Transforms;Receivers;Market research","copy protection;data privacy;discrete cosine transforms;image coding;image watermarking","digital form;illegal copyright material;digital information;digital watermarking;copyright-protection technique;original image;cover image;image processing;watermarked image;frequency transformation;possible picture transformations;watermarking applications;digital watermarks;frequency domain watermarking technique;digital content;privacy protection;internet;discrete cosine transform;image watermarking;picture decoding;picture transformations;sender side;receiver side","","","","15","IEEE","27 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The master processor executes scalar instruction packets and issues vector instruction packets to the slave coprocessor. The vector coprocessor executes wide-data arithmetic and memory operations for significant processing at the cost of high power. The power delivery for a mobile system-on-chip (SoC) processor consists of a battery that drives a PMIC to generate the SoC supply voltage (VDD) rails. The PMIC voltage regulator (VR) supplies VDD while operating below a peak-current specification (spec). If the CDSP exceeds the peak-current spec for a sustained duration, then the battery and/or PMIC VR may incur a brownout condition where VDD degrades, resulting in circuit failures. Thus, the CDSP requires a current-limiting system to prevent brownout. The latency requirement to detect the current exceeding the peak-current spec and then to respond by operating at a lower current is ~1μs. Also, the SoC must operate within a target thermal design power and temperature with detection and response latencies in 100's of μs and 10's of ms, respectively. Prior current- and temperature-limiting systems lower the phase-locked loop (PLL) clock frequency (FCLK) or reduce VDD and (FCLK) in response to exceeding current or temperature specs. Although these techniques are effective for response latencies above ~10μs, the time to reduce the PLL FCLk or VDD and FCLK far exceeds the ~10μs latency spec. Alternative approaches for satisfying the ~1μs latency target include integrating an adaptive clocking circuit after the PLL [4] or throttling the instruction-issue rate [5] to quickly change performance. These designs satisfy the latency spec by globally reducing performance without considering individual thread power or priority. This paper describes a thread-level power management (TPM) design to adapt the instruction-issue rate based on individual thread power and priority for a current- and temperature-limiting system in a 7nm [6] Hexagon CDSP. The TPM exploits low-power phases during thread execution to adjust the thread instruction-issue rate to achieve a higher performance at a target power as compared to global throttling.","2376-8606","978-1-7281-9549-0","10.1109/ISSCC42613.2021.9366001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9366001","","Power system management;Batteries;System-on-chip;VLIW;Phase locked loops;Voltage control;Coprocessors","clocks;coprocessors;digital signal processing chips;phase locked loops;power aware computing;system-on-chip;vector processor systems","Hexagon compute DSP;master VLIW scalar processor;slave vector coprocessor;energy-efficient computing;slave coprocessor;power delivery;system-on-chip processor;PMIC voltage regulator;peak-current specification;PMIC VR;response latencies;temperature-limiting systems;phase-locked loop clock frequency;thread-level power management design;Hexagon CDSP;low-power phases;thread execution;thread instruction-issue rate;7nm Hexagon processor;current-temperature-limiting system","","1","","8","IEEE","3 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Of particular note are applications in off-line programming of robots. However, before this concept finds acceptance in industry, countless problems need to be resolved. Several problems are addressed within this paper, including the requirement of an acceptable interaction device, and the subject of haptic and tactile feedback. As manufacturing continually moves to become a more responsive environment, with products having shorter life cycles and batch quantities reducing in size, robot programming times become critical, and hence an area to be addressed in order to seek improved productivity. Off-line programming is one approach, where for example off-line programming within a virtual environment could reduce the required skill levels of a programmer, reduce the programming times, allow the operator a 'natural' interface with which the operator would conduct the task in the real world, and reduce the boredom factor. This paper discusses the development of a new approach or method for the off-line programming of robotic devices, indicating some of the potential applications, and highlighting some of the restricting limitations that need to be overcome.

The requirement of high slew rate of load current with minimal output voltage deviation is challenging. In case of load transient in CCM operation, the duty ratio is almost constant over the load current range, it slightly changes to compensate the extra losses and keep output voltage regulation. While in DCM and mode hoping operation, duty ratio varies significantly in case of load transient, the compensator is required to update the error signal, consequently the duty ratio, as load current varies. Since it takes longer time for the compensator to reach the steady state in cases of large duty cycle variation (DCM operation), the output voltage deviation during load transient is drastically increased when operating in DCM compared to CCM operation. Proposed is a control method, that dynamically modulate the PWM ramp signal peak, consequently modulate the PWM modulator gain, to minimize the required error signal change during load transient, so that the compensator reach steady state faster. Therefore, lower output voltage deviation during load transient can be achieved. Principle of operation, analyses, and experimental results are presented, revealing significant load transient improvement.","2377-6617","978-1-4244-0654-8","10.1109/PESC.2007.4342315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4342315","","Pulse width modulation;Filters;Virtual reality;Steady-state;Transient response;Pulse width modulation converters;Application software;Voltage control;Error correction;Impedance","compensation;DC-DC power convertors;PWM power convertors","dynamic PWM RAMP SIGNAL;load transient;DCM;mode hoping operation;dc-dc converters;compensator;duty cycle variation;output voltage deviation;PWM ramp signal peak;PWM modulator gain","","4","","12","IEEE","8 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Formal risk analysis, an approach for automatically generating a fault tree from finite state machine-based descriptions of a system, is presented. The generated fault tree is complete with respect to all failures assumed possible.

The construction of large-scale city-level 3D model will become another important medium after images and videos. We propose an autonomous approach to reconstruct the voxel model of the scene in real-time, and estimate the best set of viewing angles according to the precision requirement. These task views are assigned to the drones based on Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) optimization. In this process, the multi-level pipelining in the chip design method is applied to accelerate the parallelism between exploration and data acquisition. Our method includes: (1) real-time perception and reconstruction of scene voxel model and obstacle avoidance; (2) determining the best observation and viewing angles of scene geometry through global and local optimization; (3) assigning the task views to the drones and planning path based on the OMT optimization, and iterating continuously according to new exploration results; (4) expediting exploration and data acquisition in parallel through multi-stage pipeline to improve efficiency. Our method can schedule routes for drones according to the scene and its optimal acquisition perspective in real-time, which avoids the model void and lack of accuracy caused by traditional aerial 3D scanning using routes of cultivating land regardless of the object, and lays a solid foundation for the 3D real-life model to directly become the available 3D data source for AR and VR. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method by collecting several groups of large-scale city-level data.

Recent computer vision techniques have made it possible to automatically reconstruct 3-D structure-from-motion points from large and unordered photo collections. Using these point clouds and a prior provided by GPS, reasonably accurate 6 degree of freedom camera poses can be obtained, thus allowing localization. Once the camera (and hence the user) is correctly localized, photos depicting scenes visible from the user's viewpoint can be used to remove unwanted objects indicated by the user in the video sequences. Existing methods based on texture synthesis bring undesirable artifacts and video inconsistency when the background is heterogeneous; the task is rendered even harder for these methods when the background contains complex structures. On the other hand, methods based on plane warping fail when the background has arbitrary shape. Unlike these methods, our algorithm copes with these problems by making use of internet photos, registering them in 3D space and obtaining the 3D scene structure in an offline process. We carefully design the various components during the online phase so as to meet both speed and quality requirements of the task.

In the emerging field of smart environments, like Smart Cities and Smart Factories for industry or agriculture, a digital counterpart of a real world site, driven by hundreds of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that emit their data in realtime, is a central part of the application. Maintaining such a large-scale virtual environment and keeping it up-to-date with changing requirements set by connected sensors and services is a challenge. For this, we present FiVES, a server framework that is based on an aspect-oriented architecture to create highly maintainable large-scale virtual environments by avoiding crosscutting concerns like tangling or scattering of code between modules in resulting applications. We present a fully functional implementation of our system that builds on an extendable and versatile data model, a flexible plugin mechanism, and a transparent yet efficient synchronization layer that is independent of the modules from which applications are assembled.","","978-1-5386-2089-2","10.1109/CW.2017.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8120305","","Virtual environments;Servers;Engines;Data models;Games;Computer architecture;Synchronization","aspect-oriented programming;data models;Internet;Internet of Things;public domain software;software architecture;virtual machines;virtual reality","FiVES;aspect-oriented Virtual environment server;Virtual Worlds;collaborative engineering;visualization;smart environments;large-scale virtual environment;connected sensors;server framework;Internet of Things sensors;synchronization layer","","4","","22","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ensuring quality of experience (QoE) for such services often requires the satisfaction of multiple quality of service (QoS) factors, e.g., short delay, high throughput rate, low packet loss. Nevertheless, existing mobile edge networks often fail to meet these requirements due to the mobility of end users and the volatility of network conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that both reduces delay and adjusts data throughput rate for QoE enhancement. We design an online service placement and throughput rate adjustment (SPTA) algorithm which coordinately migrates virtual services while tuning their data throughput rates based on real-time bandwidth fluctuation. By implementing a small-scale prototype supporting stream gaming at the edge, we show the necessity and feasibility of our work.

Indeed, a high level of interactivity is inherent in tasks involving cooking, auto repair, and home improvement, all of which require users to complete multiple, detailed, and interdependent steps. Such tasks also require access to visual and audio instructions while a user's hands are engaged in a primary, physical task, and are often conducted in unique locations, e.g., kitchen or garage. This effort describes the design of an interactive, multimodal digital entertainment user experience for an ‘edutainment’ cooking show. The prototype wireframes incorporate three novel features, identified through requirements gathering and iterative design, of an interactive recipe map for hierarchical content navigation, voice command hands-free control, and avatars to further engage users. The overall design and three features were evaluated via usability testing in real kitchen settings in the conduct of actual cooking with real ingredients with a diverse range of seven participants. The results illustrate that the hierarchical navigational feature, alongside interactive voice communication, were effective at reducing users' cognitive load, and streamlined necessary information in order to support task completion.","","978-1-6654-5111-6","10.1109/SIEDS55548.2022.9799374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9799374","","Visualization;Navigation;Avatars;Entertainment industry;Prototypes;Maintenance engineering;User experience","avatars;entertainment;handicapped aids;home computing;human computer interaction;interactive systems;speech-based user interfaces;user interfaces;virtual reality;voice communication","user interactivity;digital entertainment offer;engage users;traditional passive experiences;solitary experiences;visual instructions;audio instructions;primary task;physical task;interactive entertainment user experience;multimodal digital entertainment user experience;edutainment cooking show;interactive recipe map;hierarchical content navigation;hands-free control;hierarchical navigational feature;interactive voice communication;task completion;multimodal entertainment tool;intuitive navigation;avatar features","","","","8","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Aerial UAV-IoT sensing for ubiquitous immersive communication and virtual human teleportation","J. Chakareski","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, The University of Alabama","2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Communications Workshops (INFOCOM WKSHPS)","23 Nov 2017","2017","","","718","723","We consider UAV IoT aerial sensing that delivers multiple VR/AR immersive communication sessions to remote users. The UAV swarm is spatially distributed over a wide area of interest, and each UAV captures a viewpoint of the scene below it. The remote users are interested in visual immersive navigation of specific subareas/scenes of interest, reconstructed on their respective VR/AR devices from the captured data. The reconstruction quality of the immersive scene representations at the users will depend on the sampling/sensing rates associated with each UAV. There is a limit on the aggregate amount of data that the UAV swarm can sample and send towards the users, stemming from physical/transmission capacity constraints. Similarly, each VR/AR application has minimum reconstruction quality requirements for its own session. We propose an optimization framework that makes three contributions in this context. First, we select the optimal sampling rates to be used by each UAV, such that the system and application constraints are not exceed, while the priority weighted reconstruction quality across all VR/AR sessions is maximized. Then, we design an optimal scalable source-channel signal representation that instills into the captured data inherent rate adaptivity, unequal error protection, and minimum required redundancy. Finally, the UAV transmission efficiency is enhanced by the use of small-form-factor multi-beam directional antennas and optimal power/link scheduling across the scalable signal representation layers. Our experiments demonstrate competitive advantages over conventional methods for visual sensing. This is a first-of-its-kind study of an emerging application of prospectively broad societal impact.","","978-1-5386-2784-6","10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116465","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8116465","","Sensors;Signal representation;Conferences;Aggregates;Directional antennas;Visualization;Navigation","autonomous aerial vehicles;directive antennas;mobile radio;optimisation;signal representation;telecommunication scheduling;virtual reality","scalable signal representation layers;visual sensing;aerial UAV-IoT sensing;ubiquitous immersive communication;virtual human teleportation;UAV IoT aerial sensing;multiple VR/AR immersive communication sessions;remote users;UAV swarm;visual immersive navigation;immersive scene representations;minimum reconstruction quality requirements;optimization framework;optimal sampling rates;application constraints;priority weighted reconstruction quality;optimal scalable source-channel signal representation;captured data inherent rate adaptivity;minimum required redundancy;UAV transmission efficiency;optimal power-link scheduling;VR-AR devices;sampling-sensing rates;physical-transmission capacity constraints;VR-AR application;VR-AR sessions","","14","","64","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In air cargo industries, operating the air bridge system is of high importance, but due to the limited resources and potential damages to the aircrafts, training every operator in real world systems is difficult. To solve this problem, an air bridge simulator embedded into virtual reality systems will be a very good alternative. In this paper, a four degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robotic motion platform is designed to simulate the movement of an air bridge. The platform is driven by four pairs of motors and ball screws, and we also design a damping system for the proposed platform to avoid sudden shock. The proposed design of the structure has several advantages. Firstly, the structure itself is very simple. Secondly, due to its redundant DOF, many challenging requirements can be easily satisfied, such as singularity avoidance and energy minimization. Thirdly, as the load of the system is shared by many universal ball bull eye bearings, the required driving force of the platform is reduced drastically due to the low friction coefficient, which increases the agility of the system a lot. The inverse kinematic model (IK) of the proposed robotic air bridge simulator is also derived, and the derived IK is then used to drive the platform to perform a trajectory tracking task in simulation environment.","2162-7576","978-1-5090-4079-7","10.1109/ARSO.2016.7736258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7736258","","Bridges;Force;Robots;Virtual reality;Damping;Springs;Training","aerospace robotics;aerospace simulation;robot kinematics","robotic air bridge training system design;4 DOF robotic motion platform;air bridge movement simulation;energy minimization;singularity avoidance;universal ball bull eye bearings;inverse kinematic model;robotic air bridge simulator;trajectory tracking task","","2","","18","IEEE","7 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To sculpt objects on a computer the operator needs an instrument to enable himself to feel the virtual object. This requirement can be facilitated by the haptic device with a a collision detection response algorithm. The algorithm will ensure that the surfaces of the virtual object do not interpenetrate.

It has been designed with a constant focus on re-usability with as few hypothesis as possible on the final application in which it could be used. Whatever the chosen implementation for the Virtual Environment (VE), #FIVE : (1) provides a toolkit that eases the declaration of possible actions and behaviours of objects in the VE, (2) provides a toolkit that facilitates the setting and the management of collaborative interactions in a VE, (3) is compliant with distribution of the VE on different set-ups and (4) proposes guidelines to efficiently create a collaborative and interactive VE. It is composed of several modules, among them, two core modules : the relation engine and the collaborative interaction engine. On the one hand, the relation engine manages the relations between the objects of the environment. On the other hand, the collaborative interaction engine manages how users can collaboratively control objects. The modules that compose the #FIVE framework can be used either independently or simultaneously, depending on the requirements of the application. They can also communicate and work with other modules thanks to an API. For instance, a scenario engine can be plugged to any or both of the #FIVE modules if the application is scenario-based. #FIVE is a work in progress, new core modules will later be proposed. Nevertheless, it has already been used in some VR applications by several persons in our lab. The feedbacks we obtained are rather positive and we intent to further develop #FIVE with additional functionalities, notably by extending it to the control of avatars whether they are controlled by a user or by the system.","2328-7829","978-1-4673-6881-0","10.1109/SEARIS.2015.7854099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7854099","","Collaboration;Engines;Virtual environments;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Guidelines;Software systems","application program interfaces;avatars;groupware","#FIVE framework;high-level components;collaborative virtual environments;framework for interactive virtual environments;virtual reality;relation engine;collaborative interaction engine;API;scenario engine;avatars","","15","","20","IEEE","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We manage QoS performance by introducing pricing principles for wireless channel resource allocation based on price ""auctioning"" or ""bidding"". The network controller advertises the available QoS levels and the mobile users are competing for them by placing bid requests. Based on variability of the wireless channel, the amount of available bandwidth shared between mobile users and the bid requests, the network controller exercises QoS management. The QoS levels assigned to every customer are dynamically changed depending on the network controller optimization criterion (in this paper the network controller revenue).

With IP video distribution becoming increasingly realistic for a variety of low-latency applications, this paper looks ahead to a data-centric architecture for video that can provide a superset of features from existing abstractions, to support how video is increasingly being used: for non-linear retrieval, variable speed and spatially selective playback, machine analysis, and other new approaches. As a case study, the paper describes the use of the Named Data Networking (NDN) network architecture within an experimental theatrical work being developed at UCLA. The work, a new play, Entropy Bound, uses NDN to enable a hybrid design paradigm for real-time video that combines properties of streams, buses, and stores.

Owing to its versatility to fly inside the tunnels, it can quickly identify defects and potential problems related to safety. However, long tunnels, especially with repetitive or uniform structures pose a significant problem for UAV navigation. Furthermore, post-processing visual data from the camera mounted on the UAV is required to generate useful information for the inspection task. In this work, we design a UAV with a single rotating camera to accomplish the task. Compared to other platforms, our solution can fit the stringent requirement for tunnel inspection, in terms of battery life, size and weight. While the current state-of-the-art can estimate camera pose and 3D geometry from a sequence of images, they assume large overlap, small rotational motion, and many distinct matching points between images. These assumptions severely limit their effectiveness in tunnel-like scenarios where the camera has erratic or large rotational motion, such as the one mounted on the UAV. This paper presents a novel solution which exploits Structure-from-Motion, Bundle Adjustment, and available geometry priors to robustly estimate camera pose and automatically reconstruct a fully-dense 3D scene using the least possible number of images in various challenging tunnel-like environments. We validate our system with both Virtual Reality application and experimentation with a real dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction along with texture mapping allows for remote navigation and inspection of tunnel-like environments, even those which are inaccessible for humans.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967577","","","autonomous aerial vehicles;cameras;computer vision;data visualisation;geometry;image reconstruction;image sensors;image texture;inspection;pose estimation;stereo image processing;structural engineering computing;tunnels;virtual reality","dense 3D reconstruction;uniform structures;repetitive structures;long tunnels;unmanned aerial vehicle;visual tunnel inspection;remote navigation;challenging tunnel-like environments;fully-dense 3D scene;robustly estimate camera;structure-from-motion;tunnel-like scenarios;rotational motion;camera pose;stringent requirement;single rotating camera;inspection task;post-processing visual data;UAV navigation","","5","","34","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key concept is to share the infrastructure resources among many users at the same time and in such a way to enable them to deploy the required architectures. This leads to virtual networks (VNs), demanding different resources that have to be embedded on the underlying shared infrastructure network. The requirements of a VN can be based on factors such as, the type of traffic it needs to carry. Some portion of the same resources (substrate resources) needs to be assigned to every VN and the substrate resources are also finite. Thus, a mechanism needs to be devised in order to schedule the resources. This embedding process with resource constraints on virtual nodes and links to be applied on the substrate, which also has limited resources, is challenging and corresponds to the category of NP-hard problems. In this paper, we propose an approach to solve this problem by mapping the vertices of the VN as closely as possible in the substrate network and then assigning virtual edges to the shortest paths which satisfy their demands. This could enable the substrate to accommodate more VNs in the same resource database and hence optimize the substrate's bandwidth utilization. To the best of our knowledge closest node mapping proposed in this solution is a novel approach and is evaluated and compared to the existing approach of greedy node mapping in different scenarios. The sensitivity analysis by varying the different parameters and their effect on mapping VNs is also presented.","2156-7190","978-1-4244-8150-7","10.1109/INTERNET.2010.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616527","Network Virtualization;Virtual Network Embedding;Resource Management;Bandwidth Optimization;Scalability","","embedded systems;Internet;optimisation;virtual reality","resource efficient virtual network embedding;network virtualization;Internet ossification;network infrastructure resources;substrate resources;embedding process;resource constraints;virtual nodes;NP-hard problems;substrate network;substrate bandwidth utilization;knowledge closest node mapping;greedy node mapping","","38","","11","IEEE","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key issue in this problem is the registration of the images, i.e., the estimation of the parameters describing the global motion of the brightness pattern between them. Current approaches to global motion estimation avoid preprocessing steps, e.g., feature detection and matching, by inferring the motion parameters directly from the image intensities, through the minimization of the sum of the square error over a fixed window. This window is usually chosen as a large rectangle within the region where it is expected that the original images overlap. Although this leads to good results when the images to register have a large overlap, it often fails when the images exhibit only a small overlap, due to the requirement of choosing a priori a very small window. To overcome this limitation, we propose in this paper an adaptive window.","","0-7803-8578-0","10.1109/MMSP.2004.1436541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1436541","","Motion estimation;Image registration;Parameter estimation;Brightness;Computer vision;Motion detection;Virtual reality;Video compression;Pixel;Robots","image registration;parameter estimation;image motion analysis;image matching;feature extraction","image registration;small overlap;parameter estimation;global motion estimation;feature detection;image matching","","4","","6","IEEE","6 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, the integration of this technology in mobile phones has increased the number of potential users to millions in a short period of time. In this paper we present BluePartner, a novel application for mobile social networks. BluePartner was developed to be used in mobile devices, and to take advantage of Bluetooth functionalities to promote human relationships. Our application periodically scans the wireless environment to search for other users of BluePartner; when found, an exchange of personal cards takes place where preferences, likes/dislikes, etc. are available to assess the degree of matching between both users. High degrees of matching result in an exchange of more information, so that both users are aware of how to reach each other in a future. Contrarily to other efforts to promote human relationships through virtual reality environments, BluePartner embraces a paradigm where computers are invisible, operating in the background to achieve a more easier integration with users and their environment.","2330-989X","978-1-4244-4387-1","10.1109/LATINCOM.2009.5304858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5304858","Bluetooth;BluePartner;Wireless networks","Humans;Bluetooth;Mobile communication;Ad hoc networks;Social network services;Communication standards;Protocols;Microcomputers;Application software;Mobile computing","ad hoc networks;Bluetooth;mobile computing;mobile radio;social networking (online);virtual reality","BluePartner;human relationship;mobile device;Bluetooth interface;mobile social network;wireless environment;personal card exchange;virtual reality environment;mobile ad hoc network","","1","","18","IEEE","30 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the latency requirements are challenging to meet due to the resources required by video-based remoting of graphics, that is, decoding video codecs. We propose an approach towards tackling this challenge: a client-server implementation for transacting intermediate representation (IR) between a mobile UE and a MEC server instead of video codecs and this way avoiding video decoding. We demonstrate the ability to address latency bottlenecks on edge computing workloads that transact graphics. We select SPIR-V compatible GPU kernels as the intermediate representation. Our approach requires know-how in GPU architecture and GPU domain-specific languages (DSLs), but compared to video-based edge graphics, it decreases UE device delay by sevenfold. Further, we find that due to low cold-start times on both UEs and MEC servers, application migration can happen in milliseconds. We imply that graphics-based location-aware applications, such as MR, can benefit from this kind of approach.","","978-1-7281-6047-4","10.1109/6GSUMMIT49458.2020.9083751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9083751","","","client-server systems;distributed processing;graphics processing units;mobile computing;operating system kernels;virtual reality","application migration;graphics-based location-aware applications;interoperable GPU kernels;mixed reality applications;latency requirements;client-server implementation;MEC server;edge computing workloads;mobile user equipment;SPIR-V compatible GPU kernel;GPU architecture;GPU domain-specific languages","","1","","14","IEEE","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For real-time considerations, these systems become computationally very challenging, especially when video streaming is included. The addition of stereoscopic video streaming is desirable in virtual environments (VE) created for the teaching of anatomy and surgery with real-time collaborative audio and video interactions at many locations. However, this stresses the real-time requirements to the point at which realistic video is difficult to assure. For such a system to work, it is imperative that timing data be collected, analyzed and understood. We describe an experimental system designed primarily for the collection of timing data that is required for robust collaborative medical training applications. The networked stereoscopic system uses a server-swappable multicast network protocol to stream real-time manipulations of 3D virtual body structures at the server site to all clients participating in the multicast session. The three visual modes have dynamic tuning parameters for adjusting the parallax and the focal point for the rendered scene, allowing users to define individual stereoscopic comfort zones. Optimizing the graphics module is critical in achieving the necessary rendering rates. Different techniques of utilizing various memory resources increased the number of polygons rendered per second by over seven million. Depending on the type of memory used, the number of polygons rendered per second varies from 2.25 to 9.12 million.","1063-7125","0-7695-1004-3","10.1109/CBMS.2001.941753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=941753","","Virtual environment;Rendering (computer graphics);Multicast protocols;Real time systems;Streaming media;Collaborative work;Timing;Collaboration;Computer displays;Education","stereo image processing;virtual reality;distributed processing;biomedical communication;real-time systems;visual communication;surgery;biomedical education;educational technology;groupware;multicast communication;rendering (computer graphics);medical computing","networked stereoscopic virtual environment system;collaborative display systems;computing desktop environment;platform independence;location independence;collaborative audiovisual interactions;stereoscopic video streaming;server-swappable multicast network protocol;teaching;anatomy;surgery;real-time requirements;timing data collection;robust collaborative medical training applications;3D virtual body structures;visual modes;dynamic tuning parameters;parallax adjustment;focal point adjustment;rendered scene;individual stereoscopic comfort zones;graphics module optimization;rendering rate;memory resource utilization;polygons","","","","3","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If an environment is not seen as legitimate, social conflicts may reduce community benefits like trade and e-commerce. Legitimacy must be built into a VCE at design time, or it may not be possible at all. This can be done using a legitimacy requirements framework (LRF) which interprets historical ""rights"" in terms of ownership of generic VCE objects. This involves more than merely specifying who has the right to do what to what, because objects may contain other objects, objects may be dependent, rights may interact, groups may have rights, and there may be rights to rights. A LRF could be used by software designers to derive legitimacy requirements for a wide variety of multi-user systems, from chat rooms to virtual realities. It would draw focus to common problems, and aid their common solution. A simple LRF is presented to provide a basis for designers of virtual social environments to copy, discuss or deviate from.","","0-7695-1435-9","10.1109/HICSS.2002.994240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994240","","Internet;Software design;Information systems;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Educational technology;Contracts;Virtual reality;Application software;Bandwidth","groupware;Internet","social requirements specification;trusted virtual community environment;social conflicts;trade;e-commerce;legitimacy requirements framework;chat rooms;virtual realities","","1","","41","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stochastic nature of load demand and output power from renewable energy resources is taken into account. An algorithm was developed, based upon active power requests for VPP, weather conditions and expected consumer loading, which optimizes dispatch of controllable generators in order to track the production of intermittent sources and in that way make VPP wanted output. Simulations were carried out on a real distribution network (Sopot, part of Zagreb) through one usual consumption day comparing three scenarios of VPP controllability and investigating the best scenario either for the Distribution System Operator (DSO), either for VPP.

In this paper, we propose a genetic approach for distributing the semantic database of crowd simulations in such a way that the dependencies among the computers hosting the pieces of the database are minimized. The proposed approach avoids the saturation of these computers by ensuring that the size of the pieces assigned to each computer is properly balanced. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the resulting overhead in regard to other local search methods, regardless of the movement pattern of the agents. Therefore, it allows an effective partition of the semantic database.","1530-2075","1-4244-0909-8","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228155","","Genetics;Image databases;Visual databases;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Distributed computing;Virtual environment;Application software;Rendering (computer graphics);Autonomous agents","database management systems;genetic algorithms;rendering (computer graphics);resource allocation;search problems;virtual reality","crowd simulation;virtual environment application;visually plausible image rendering;autonomous agent;semantic database;load balancing;performance evaluation;local search method;genetic approach","","3","","24","IEEE","11 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The requirement of weight and volume is strict for space agencies, and hence it is necessary to optimize the structural dimensions of the special flexspline. This paper presents an optimization of the different flexspline by using response surface method. A finite element equivalent model of the flexspline was built. In addition, the optimized design points and response surface were provided to achieve an optimum flexspline, and Von-Mises stress sensitivity was obtained.

Although high-tech weapon systems such as advanced antisubmarine torpedoes, ""smart"" missiles, and sophisticated electronics grab all the headlines, the gun remains a potent means of influencing events both at sea and ashore. One of the most important functions of the large caliber gun is in support of Naval Surface Fire Support-those strike operations that enable amphibious assaults. Typical missions include shore-based spotter calls for fire against enemy soldiers, mechanized convoys, and threat weapon bunkers during the critical initial period when the Marines are first ashore. Termed Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS), training for such missions has traditionally been conducted on a limited number of land-based gunnery ranges in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Recently, however, this situation has changed and become a critical training deficiency: the range at Kahoalawe, HI was closed in 1993 for Hawaiian religious and environmental reasons, the range on San Clemente Island, CA, is being re-examined from an environmental perspective, and the range on Vieques Island, Puerto Rico, has been severely restricted because of an unfortunate accident. To meet this need, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport has developed a virtual training capability for live fire Naval Gunfire Support that is in place in Hawaii and being considered for the Middle Atlantic Region. It is based on firing at a virtual target located on the surface of the sea and detecting hit points acoustically. Above-surface and illumination rounds are scored optically.

Used (gray) water draining from the sinks and shower in the crew habitat module is routed through PVC pipes into the GreenHab, which consists of a series of aerobic and anaerobic water tanks, filters, and a UV treatment device, all housed in a greenhouse-like structure next to the MDRS habitat module. Flow meters measure gray water flow rates coming into and going out of the GreenHab. The water data collected during the Moonbase Sim 1 are summarized in the paper, along with recommendations for further developments in water reclamation systems. Some of the projects undertaken by other crewmembers include a study on color differentiation within a substantially monochromatic environment, the development of a virtual reality tour of the MDRS and local environs, a crew psycho-social survey, and the development of an ""Early Space Frontier Diet"". Results of these projects can be reviewed at this website address: www.marssociety.org/MDRS/fs05/0311/sum.asp Finally, this paper offers observations and recommendations in the areas of overall simulation design, system and equipment design, crew selection, personnel policies, and facilities requirements.","1095-323X","1-4244-0524-6","10.1109/AERO.2007.352983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4161701","","Space stations;Moon;Web page design;Mars;Biomechanics;Performance evaluation;Testing;Filters;Fluid flow measurement;Virtual reality","aerospace simulation;aerospace test facilities;space research","inner space;Moon Desert Research Station;AD 02 28 2006 to 03 07 2006;Mars Desert Research Station;Hanksville;Utah;Moonbase mission simulation;Artemis Moonbase Sim 1;water reclamation;spacesuit biomechanics;crew time allocation;flow meters;used water draining;crew habitat module;PVC pipes;GreenHab;anaerobic water tanks;UV treatment device;greenhouse-like structure;MDRS habitat module;gray water flow rates;color differentiation;substantially monochromatic environment;virtual reality;Early Space Frontier Diet","","","","7","IEEE","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Low energy data and concurrency management of highly dynamic real-time multi-media systems","F. Catthoor","IMEC, Belgium","2nd Workshop onEmbedded Systems for Real-Time Multimedia, 2004. ESTImedia 2004.","22 Nov 2004","2004","","","4","","Summary form only given. The merging of computers, consumer and communication disciplines gives rise to very fast growing markets for personal communication, multi-media and broadband networks, in the information technology (IT) area. Rapid evolution in sub-micron process technology allows ever more complex systems to be mapped on platforms that become integrated on one single platform (system -on-chip). Technology advances are however not followed by an increase in system design productivity. One of the most critical bottlenecks is the very dynamic concurrent behaviour of many of these new applications. They are fully specified in software oriented languages (like Java, UML, SDL, C++) and still need to be executed in real-time cost/energy sensitive way on the heterogeneous SoC platforms. The main issue is that fully design time based solutions as proposed earlier in the compiler and system synthesis cannot solve the problem, and run-time solutions as present in nowadays operating systems are too inefficient in terms of cost optimisation (especially energy consumption) and are also not adapted for the real-time constraints (even RTOS kernels). This dynamic nature is especially emerging because of the quality-of-service (QoS) aspects of these multi-media and networking applications. Prominent examples of this can be found in the recent MPEG4/JPEG2000 standards and especially the new MPEG21 standard. Also the emerging Ambient Intelligence and virtual reality paradigms will stimulate this further. In order to deal with these dynamic issues where tasks and complex data types are created and deleted at run-time based on non-deterministic events, a novel system design paradigm is required. This presentation will focus on the new requirements that result in system-level synthesis. In particular both a ""dynamic data management"" and a ""task concurrency management"" problem formulation will be presented, that have to deal with the very dynamic nature of these systems. The concept of Pareto curve based exploration is crucial in these problem formulations and their solutions.","","0-7803-8631-0","10.1109/ESTMED.2004.1359690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1359690","","Concurrent computing;Energy management;Real time systems;Multimedia systems;Multimedia communication;Runtime;Merging;Computer networks;Broadband communication;Information technology","real-time systems;multimedia systems;concurrency control","real-time systems;multi-media systems;quality-of-service;system design paradigm;system-level synthesis;dynamic data management;task concurrency management;Pareto curve;system-on-chip","","","","","IEEE","22 Nov 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus the proposed scheme can satisfy the QoS requirements of real-time applications. The BFR scheme uses the token on the row ring to provide QoS guarantees. The performance of the BFR scheme is analyzed by using the Geom/Geom/1 queueing system under uniform traffic. In the simulation, the BFR scheme shows the zero-loss, high-throughput performance with the minimum delay variation compared to other routing protocols such as store and forward routing, deflection routing and vertical routing.

This paper analyzes how these requirements could potentially be met by MPEG-4 and shows that MPEG-4 tools could be extremely useful for the development of such environments.","","0-8186-8150-0","10.1109/VSMM.1997.622324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=622324","","MPEG 4 Standard;Collaboration;Layout;Virtual environment;Video compression;Facial animation;MPEG standards;Transform coding;Shape;Engines","audio coding;video coding;data compression;groupware;distributed processing;virtual reality;multimedia systems;code standards","MPEG-4;networked collaborative virtual environments;audio-visual data coding;audio-visual data compression;multiple natural audio-visual objects;synthetic audio;synthetic video;natural objects;networking requirements","","3","","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The underlying approach to recognize and analyze the facial movements of a real performance is described in detail. The output of the program is directly compatible with MPEG-4 standard parameters and therefore enhances the ability to use the available data in any other MPEG-4 compatible application. The real-time facial analysis system gives the user the ability to control the graphics system by means of facial expressions. This is used primarily with real-time facial animation systems, where the synthetic actor reproduces the animator's expression.

The telepresence application places additional requirements on the compressed representation, such as preservation of depth discontinuities, low complexity decoding, and amenability to real-time rendering using graphics cards. We propose a simplified triangular mesh representation that can be encoded efficiently. The mesh geometry is encoded using a binary triangle tree structure and the depths at the tree nodes are differentially coded. By matching the tree traversal to the mesh rendering order, both depth map decoding and triangle strip generation for efficient rendering are achieved simultaneously. The proposed scheme naturally lends itself to coding segmented foreground layers. Our experiments show a significant improvement in rendering speeds at similar compression rates using the new mesh based depth map representation when compared to independent representations for compression and rendering.","1522-4880","0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1039931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039931","","Rendering (computer graphics);Decoding;Tree graphs;Video compression;Cameras;Graphics;Geometry;Tree data structures;Strips;Mesh generation","data compression;rendering (computer graphics);video coding;virtual reality;visual communication;image representation;computational geometry;tree data structures;decoding","telepresence;depth-based new view rendering;depth map compression;dynamic depth maps;video transmission;depth discontinuity preservation;triangular mesh representation;mesh geometry;binary triangle tree structure;tree node depths;differential coding;mesh rendering order;tree traversal matching;depth map decoding;triangle strip generation;segmented foreground layers","","1","2","5","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional method for the simulation of EMG is based on the physiological mechanisms of muscle contraction. So, it is very important to deeply understand the physiological mechanisms of muscle contraction. Actually, this mechanism is very complicated, and it is usually very hard to simulation the specific EMG signals for a specific subject. A new technique was developed. It is based on the experiment data and eliminates the need to collect EMG signals by electrode. This new technique demonstrated at least as similar signal shapes and similar model fidelity when compared to the traditional technique, indicating that it is a valid alternative to traditional method. The subjects who were once joined the experiment and the EMG collection systems are no longer needed. In particular, this technique will be valuable for evaluating some exertion once can't be taken, or can't be finished by the specific subject. In addition, based on those already existing subjects, it is very easy to set the relevant properties of specific subject, and then generate virtual subject and the simulated EMG signal according to any simulation conditions.","","978-1-4799-6575-5","10.1109/IMCCC.2014.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994996","Electromyography (EMG);Biomechanical model;Experiment data;Lifting;Subject;Simulator","Electromyography;Databases;Muscles;Neural networks;Biological system modeling;Physiology;Data models","biomechanics;electromyography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;pattern matching;physiological models;signal reconstruction;virtual reality","electromyography simulator;experiment data;electromyography assisted biodynamic model development;EMG signal simulation requirement;physiological mechanism;muscle contraction mechanism;EMG signal collection system;similar signal shape;similar model fidelity;specific subject properties;virtual subject generation;simulation condition","","","","33","IEEE","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many different event models have been developed to address the requirements of different application domains. One such model is the ECO (events, constraints, objects) model, which was designed to support distributed virtual world applications. Like many other event models, ECO has event-filtering capabilities that are meant to improve scalability by decreasing the network traffic in a distributed implementation. Our recent work in event-based systems has included building a fully-distributed version of the ECO model, including event-filtering capabilities. This paper describes the results of our evaluation of filters as a means of achieving increased scalability in the ECO model. The evaluation is empirical, and real data gathered from an actual event-based system is used. The findings show that: (i) filters are highly valuable in making distributed implementations of the model scale, (ii) multicasting contributes to the scalability and, perhaps most significantly, (iii) multicast groups can be dynamically generated from filters using local (per-node) knowledge rather than global knowledge of the distributed application.","","0-7695-0634-8","10.1109/PDSE.2000.847853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=847853","","Filters","distributed object management;filters;telecommunication traffic;multicast communication;filtering theory;virtual reality","event filtering;scalability;ECO distributed event model;event-based communication;constraints;objects;distributed virtual world applications;network traffic;fully-distributed version;multicast groups;local knowledge","","13","2","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The FEM transformer design method is discussed in detail. ATVC is a solution to the challenging transient requirement of VRM under high slew rate load current. It only works in transient periods and the main VR operates in low frequency which results in high efficiency. In the steady state, the transformer is just a paralleled large filter inductor. In transient periods, ATVC acts as a transformer, injecting or absorbing high slew rate current that is determined by the transformer leakage inductance. The numerical FEM method is used to design the transformer according to the transformer's actual working conditions. The accurate and frequency dependable transformer magnetizing inductance value and the leakage inductance value of each winding can be decided from the FEM results directly. The simulation and experiment results verify this transformer design.

To be cost-effective, a key functional requirement for such infrastructure is enabling the sharing of heterogeneous resources amongst tenants/service providers supporting spatially varying and dynamic user demands. This paper proposes a resource allocation criterion, namely, Share Constrained Slicing (SCS), for slices allocated predefined shares of the network's resources, which extends traditional α-fairness criterion, by striking a balance among inter- and intra-slice fairness vs. overall efficiency. We show that SCS has several desirable properties including slice-level protection, envy-freeness, and load-driven elasticity. In practice, mobile users' dynamics could make the cost of implementing SCS high, so we discuss the feasibility of using a simpler (dynamically) weighted max-min as a surrogate resource allocation scheme. For a setting with stochastic loads and elastic user requirements, we establish a sufficient condition for the stability of the associated coupled network system. Finally, and perhaps surprisingly, we show via extensive simulations that while SCS (and/or the surrogate weighted max-min allocation) provides inter-slice protection, they can achieve improved job delay and/or perceived throughput, as compared to other weighted max-min based allocation schemes whose intra-slice weight allocation is not share-constrained, e.g., traditional max-min or discriminatory processor sharing.","","978-3-903176-20-1","10.23919/WiOPT47501.2019.9144138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144138","","Resource management;Elasticity;Computational modeling;Network slicing;Data analysis;Dynamic scheduling;Stability criteria","cloud computing;data privacy;minimax techniques;mobile computing;resource allocation;telecommunication security","network edge;heterogeneous resources;resource allocation criterion;α-fairness criterion;slice-level protection;load-driven elasticity;mobile users;elastic user requirements;coupled network system;surrogate weighted max-min allocation;inter-slice protection;discriminatory processor sharing;weighted max-min based allocation;intra-slice weight allocation;surrogate resource allocation;intra-slice fairness;share constrained slicing;elastic multiresource network slicing;privacy requirements;data-intensive mobile applications;cloud computing","","1","","33","","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, the facility to define data accessibility, and the ability to reuse human readable names based on a variable's scope is a common feature of most programming languages.

Cal Poly Pomona has implemented the next generation distance learning technique we named the Global Laboratory Environment (GLEn) with support from the W. M. Keck Foundation. This environment allows users around the world to access and operate equipment over the Internet in real time. Unlike the previous generation of remote access over the Internet, this environment allows users to see the equipment in the laboratory or at a remote location to operate it without local intervention. The concept of having a laboratory made from equipment at multiple universities, at remote locations, or at industrial sites is now viable. It seems that the concept of the educational or research laboratory as we know it today is going to change dramatically. New alliances will be formed between different universities, government agencies, and with private companies whereby equipment can be shared. This concept is very important for some schools and companies since it means that schools, government agencies, or companies with equipment can share with schools and companies without equipment. In this paper is a discussion of how the Global Laboratory concept is implemented to enhance and expand the learning experience in our Ocean Engineering Program. A discussion of the initial problems that were encountered with implementing the equipment interaction over the Internet and the solutions found for those problems is presented. As result of this work we have identified what we believe will be the second generation of this concept and have already begun to develop the techniques and software that will be required. In attempting to implement this concept within an educational environment sets several limitations to the work. First the cost of implementing must be low at both the remote instrument location and the remote user's location. Secondly, the system must be easily accessible and easy to operate. This second requirement is necessary in an educational setting because students taking classes have very limited time to learn how to operate an instrumentation system before they move on to the next class. Thirdly, the system must be reliable and operate in real time. A solution to each of these problems has been derived. The typical costs for the needed software is about $150, the time to train to use the equipment is about 3 hours, the delay was measured to be in the range of less than 1 second to 5 seconds. so that they can access their instruments at any time and from anywhere in the world with a minimum cost requirement. Besides presenting the concept and system configurations, we report on using this laboratory concept with instrumentation developed by our students and implemented.","","0-933957-28-9","10.1109/OCEANS.2001.968280","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=968280","","Internet;Instruments;Remote monitoring;Oceans;Educational institutions;Laboratories;Costs;Computer aided instruction;Government;Virtual reality","Internet;distance learning;student experiments;oceanographic equipment;physical instrumentation control;telecontrol;computerised monitoring;marine telemetry","remote Internet instrumentation;monitoring;ocean data;distance learning;Cal Poly Pomona;Global Laboratory Environment;GLEn;educational laboratory;research laboratory;Global Laboratory concept;Ocean Engineering Program;equipment interaction;instrumentation system","","","","8","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The realization process of the interactive communication module is analyzed, and the implementation mechanism and process of virtual scene interaction are introduced. In the two-dimensional map, the plane coordinates are transmitted to the virtual scene, then using the relocation function to get the coordinates in the virtual scene, and display virtual scenes centered on this coordinates to achieve the purpose of interactive virtual scene.

Due to the heterogeneity of the various virtual worlds and their domain requirements, we propose exploiting the modularity, generality, and granularity dimensions of ontologies to simplify and empower the choreography modeling capabilities. Instead of a unique ontology, several ontologies with different levels of generality and granularity can be progressively combined to support the modeling requirements of a given choreography. Because these ontologies are aligned with the ontology of each specific virtual world platform, the mapping and transformation between the core ontology is simplified and automated, thus reducing the development and time-to-market.","1943-6106","978-1-4673-0853-3","10.1109/VLHCC.2012.6344502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344502","virtual worlds;choreographies;multi-user;ontology;combination;mapping","Ontologies;Data models;Humans;Engines;Computer architecture;Games;Strips","groupware;human computer interaction;ontologies (artificial intelligence);virtual reality","platform-independent multiuser choreography;ontology combination;ontology mapping;system architecture;platform-independent choreography;ontology-based solution;multiuser choreography capture;multiuser choreography representation;technical characteristics;virtual world technological platform;domain requirement;modularity dimension;generality dimension;granularity dimension;choreography modeling;time-to-market","","5","","16","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to reduce the wastefulness of bandwidth, the system always employs a grouping scheme to divide the entities into groups and only sends messages to the groups that would be interested in them. In this paper, we describe two well-known grouping strategies: entity-based grouping and cell-based grouping, and propose the tracking-needless grouping strategy for reducing the overhead of message sending. The simulation results show that it facilitates designing an efficient and scalable NVE system.

However, Conventional packaging technologies are gradually unable to meet the requirements of 3D IC or high-power devices operated in extremely harsh environments. In our previous work, we proposed a novel approach based on a transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding for forming face-centered cubic solid-solution joints without the formation of intermetallic compounds. A trace amount of gallium (Ga) and nickel (Ni) in an under-bump-metallurgy (UBM) process at 300°C for 24 h with high-strength and excellent thermal stability. In this study, due to the high surface tension of liquid Ga and the long time it takes to form the bonding joints, liquid Ga was replaced with Ga-based submicron particles (SMPs) by a sonochemical process. With Ga-based paste and Ni UBM, high-strength, thermally stable, and low resistance Cu-to-Cu bonding joints can be fabricated at a relatively low temperature and short bonding time comparing to the process reported in our previous work. The industrial application of Ga-based SMPs was conclusively demonstrated by a series of evaluations of Ga-based SMPs and Cu-to-Cu bonding joints.","","978-4-9902-1887-4","10.23919/ICEP.2019.8733446","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8733446","3D IC;Cu-to-Cu bonding;high power device;solid-solution type TLP;sonochemical process;Ga-based particles","Bonding;Nickel;Thermal stability;Liquids;Gallium;Materials science and technology","bonding processes;copper;gallium;metallurgy;nickel;semiconductor device packaging;surface tension;thermal stability","nickel;under-bump-metallurgy process;excellent thermal stability;high surface tension;liquid Ga;Ga-based submicron particles;sonochemical process;Ga-based paste;Ni UBM;short bonding time;Ga-based SMPs;novel TLP bonding;sub-micron Ga particles;electronic devices;electronic packaging industries;3D IC;high-power devices;transient liquid phase bonding;face-centered cubic solid-solution joints;low resistance Cu-to-Cu bonding joints;gallium;wide bandgap semiconductor packaging;temperature 300.0 degC;time 24.0 hour;Ga;Ni;Cu","","","","14","","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Factoring user interactivity into computer system design and evaluation is important, yet possesses many challenges. In particular, systematically studying interactive mobile applications across the diverse set of mobile devices available today is difficult due to the mobile device fragmentation problem. At the time of writing, there are 18,796 distinct Android mobile devices on the market and will only continue to increase in the future. Differences in screen sizes, resolutions and operating systems impose different interactivity requirements, making it difficult to uniformly study these systems. We present Mosaic, a cross-platform, timing-accurate record and replay tool for Android-based mobile devices. Mosaic overcomes device fragmentation through a novel virtual screen abstraction. User interactions are translated from a physical device into a platform-agnostic intermediate representation before translation to a target system. The intermediate representation is human-readable, which allows Mosaic users to modify previously recorded traces or even synthesize their own user interactive sessions from scratch. We demonstrate that Mosaic allows user interaction traces to be recorded on emulators, smartphones, tablets, and development boards and replayed on other devices. Using Mosaic we were able to replay 45 different Google Play applications across multiple devices, and also show that we can perform cross-platform performance comparisons between two different processors under identical user interactions.","","978-1-4799-1957-4","10.1109/ISPASS.2015.7095807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7095807","","Smart phones;Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Quantization (signal);Hardware","mobile computing;smart phones;user interfaces;virtual reality","Mosaic;cross-platform user-interaction record;Android ecosystem;mobile application;user interactivity;Android mobile device;virtual screen abstraction;user interactive session","","38","1","25","IEEE","30 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose the use of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks for 3D streaming, and argue that due to the non-linear access patterns of 3D content, P2P 3D streaming is a new class of applications apart from existing media streaming and requires new investigations. We also present FLoD, the first P2P 3D streaming framework that allows clients of 3D virtual globe or virtual environment (VE) applications to obtain relevant data from other clients while minimizing server resource usage. To demonstrate how FLoD applies to real-world scenarios, we build a prototype system that adapts JPEG 2000-based 3D mesh streaming for P2P delivery. Experiments show that server-side bandwidth usage can thus be reduced, while simulations indicate that P2P 3D streaming is fundamentally more scalable than client-server approaches.","0743-166X","978-1-4244-2025-4","10.1109/INFOCOM.2008.195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4509790","","Peer to peer computing;Streaming media;Layout;Bandwidth;Computer science;Virtual environment;Navigation;Earth;Communications Society;Information management","client-server systems;media streaming;peer-to-peer computing;virtual reality","peer-to-peer network;Internet;client-server delivery methods;nonlinear access pattern;3D media streaming;virtual environment application;JPEG 2000","","55","","18","IEEE","2 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But in the developing countries, physical facilities of science education accessible to people are in disadvantageous condition. With the rapid development of internet technology (IT), services based on IT will be more and more in use, such as virtual museums (including virtual science and technology museums, virtual nature museums, and so on). Virtual museums could be developed as a feasible way for science education in developing countries. In china, people who are measured as having basic scientific literacy accounts for only 3.27% of the respondents according to the eighth civic scientific literacy survey in 2010. The rate is far below that of the developed countries such as USA, and some others.

It is therefore, important to understand how these factors affect the durability of facades, leading to a requirement of expert analysis. In this paper, we propose a technical pipeline and a set of interaction techniques to support data analysis within the immersive environment for our case study.

On one hand, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is an effective network paradigm to provide low transmission latency and massive computation for 360° videos. On the other hand, viewport adaptive streaming also provides a bandwidth efficient solution. Accordingly, in this paper, we investigate the caching policy for tile-based 360° videos in an MEC caching system. Our goal is to find the optimal caching policy to co-optimize users’ quality of experience (QoE) and MEC energy consumption with no a-priori knowledge on video content popularity. We apply the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) theory to solve the above problem which is a sequential decision making problem. On the basis of the combinatorial UCB (CUCB), an improved algorithm is proposed to speed up learning process. The outcome of the algorithm is the caching decision for each time slot. The effectiveness of the proposed learning based caching policy is confirmed by simulation results in terms of the learning speed, hit rate, energy consumption and request latency.","1558-2612","978-1-6654-4266-4","10.1109/WCNC51071.2022.9771944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9771944","MEC;tile-based 360°;video;optimal caching policy;latency and energy consumption;multi-armed bandit","Energy consumption;Solid modeling;Multi-access edge computing;Simulation;Conferences;Decision making;Bandwidth","5G mobile communication;augmented reality;cache storage;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of experience;virtual reality","Mobile Edge Computing;effective network paradigm;low transmission;massive computation;viewport adaptive;bandwidth efficient solution;tile-based 360° videos;MEC caching system;optimal caching policy;co-optimize users;video content popularity;combinatorial multiarmed bandit;sequential decision making problem;learning process;caching decision;learning based caching policy;learning speed;energy consumption;360° video Edge caching policy;5G mobile network;immersive requirement;technical challenges","","2","","11","IEEE","16 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These decisions often require humans to perceive, comprehend, project, and then communicate information in a timely and accurate manner, oftentimes with life-or-death consequences. To support these decisions, Department of Defense leaders are calling for more effective representations and displays of joint warfighting environments. This project addresses this requirement by examining novel technologies for integrating and displaying complex MDO plans for human decision-making. Using a mission planning scenario, we assessed situation awareness (SA), usability, cost, and overall effectiveness of a two-dimensional (2D) representation of a common joint warfighting display on a Samsung tablet against a three-dimensional (3D) display of the same information designed for use in a Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality system. A total of 22 U.S. Air Force Academy cadets were randomly assigned to either use the tablet or the HoloLens to develop and analyze a mission plan and assessed for situation awareness across two scenarios. Interestingly, the HoloLens did not provide any additional SA relative to the tablet. The tablet was also perceived as more usable and effective in terms of cost and overall performance.

This lack of detail in the definition and presentation of the modelled environment to the user, can constitute a serious loss in accurately bring across the correct impression of the situation. This deficiency can be put down to two reasons: the inability of modelling systems to conveniently capture large quantities of information about a real situation; and the inability of the target presentation systems to render large volumes of model information sufficiently quickly to cope with a real-time display requirement. A combination of techniques are used to generate model information automatically. In essence, a specification and a set of rules is supplied to the generation engine describing in loose detail the nature of the scene to be represented. These rules are then used in combination with various algorithms to produce the desired effect.

The difficulties in setting up very large IoT networks do not permit us to stress test the systems and argue about their performance and their durability. To tackle this problem, this work proposes EMU-IoT, a virtual lab for IoT technologies. Using virtualization and container technologies, we demonstrate an experimentation infrastructure to enable researchers and other practitioners to conduct large scale experiments and test several quality aspects of IoT systems with minimal requirements in devices and other equipment.

The surface of the lumen outer wall was modeled as isotropic elastic shell elements. The insufflation procedure was simulated by nonlinear finite element method with a constant air pressure exerted on the interior of the shell. The deformation of the inner surface of the lumen was implemented by thin plate spline based kernel transformation. Experiments with both phantom and ten CT data sets were designed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show the insufflated lumen is helpful in extending visual field, and extracting exact centerline. Therefore, it will improve visualization quality of virtual straightening, unfolding, and eversion. Compared to the real insufflation, the virtual insufflation can be performed on any kind of surfaces without the closed requirement, and does not change the status of the inner surface. The virtual insufflation will be an effective complement of the real insufflation, especially in some organs, such as blood vessel and bladder, that are unsuitable or hard to insufflate, and some patients who have perforations with increasing risk if performing insufflation.","","978-1-4244-9306-7","10.1109/CISP.2011.6100551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6100551","vitrual lumen insufflation;virtual endoscropy;nonlinear finite element;thin plate spline based kernel transform","Finite element methods;Computed tomography;Kernel;Materials;Biomedical imaging;Colon;Algorithm design and analysis","cancer;computerised tomography;data visualisation;endoscopes;feature extraction;finite element analysis;medical image processing;nonlinear equations;splines (mathematics);virtual reality","virtual lumen insufflation algorithm;virtual endoscopy;pipe-like organs;nonpipe-like organs;lumen outer wall;isotropic elastic shell elements;nonlinear finite element method;constant air pressure;lumen inner surface deformation;thin plate spline based kernel transformation;CT data sets;exact centerline extraction;visualization quality;virtual straightening;virtual unfolding;virtual eversion;colorectal cancer","","","","18","IEEE","12 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enhance man-machine communication with more natural and efficient information presentation, this framework adds animated agents to AR applications that make autonomous decisions based on their perception of the real environment. These agents are able to turn physical objects into interactive, responsive entities collaborating with both anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic virtual characters, extending AR with a previously unexplored output modality.

However, certain instabilities may occur that cannot be attributed to these hardware limitations. The problem becomes acute when rendering passive virtual environments which require compensation of the intrinsic device dynamics. We show that passivity, the standard robust stability criteria for haptic interface systems, cannot be maintained in certain circumstances due to Bode gain-phase integral constraints. In an experimental study, we demonstrate that some performance can be recovered by relaxing passivity requirements while maintaining coupled stability. To test stability, we identify frequency domain models of the user interaction, and check the Nyquist stability criterion rather than passivity.","","978-1-4244-3858-7","10.1109/WHC.2009.4810894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4810894","coupled stability;passivity;Nyquist stability criterion;Bode gain-phase integral;impedance control;frequency-domain user modeling","Haptic interfaces;Hardware;Stability criteria;Control nonlinearities;Sampling methods;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Quantization;Cause effect analysis;Rendering (computer graphics);Virtual environment","haptic interfaces;Nyquist stability;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","haptic performance recovering;passivity requirement relaxing;user interaction;sampling effects;sensor quantization;hardware nonlinearities;passive virtual environment rendering;intrinsic device dynamics of the;robust stability criteria;haptic interface systems;Nyquist stability criterion","","1","","20","IEEE","3 Apr 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transmission of the complete 360° video in desirable quality can lead to multiple times UHD resolution which would waste a large fraction of network resources as the larger fraction of the video is not presented on the end device. Adaptivity to the user viewport promises substantial benefits and contrary to per-user or per-orientation encoding, tiled based streaming provides a scalable solution.

In this paper, we propose an architecture for implementing an agent called virtual inhabitant which can provide diverse and social actions just like those of human-controlled characters. To achieve these human-like actions, the virtual inhabitant should behave diversely, live long in the virtual environment, make social relationships with others, keep the relationships in his lifetime, and have self-updating abilities. To fulfill these requirements, we design the architecture to utilize the agent's full rationality, discrepancies, and other human-like features such as oblivions, and so on as the essential sources of an agent's diverse and social actions. We roughly divide the architecture into four submodules and sophisticatedly design each module in order to support these features effectively. The proposed model can be used for implementing virtual inhabitant for online games, member of virtual community, and pedagogical agents in intelligent tutoring systems with merely selecting and combining the submodules included in the proposed architecture.","","0-7695-2084-7","10.1109/MULMM.2004.1265002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265002","","Computer architecture;Virtual environment;Intelligent systems;Intelligent agent;Computer networks;Automata;Neural networks;Autonomous agents","software agents;human factors;virtual reality;computer games;intelligent tutoring systems","agent architecture;virtual inhabitant;online games;virtual communities;diverse actions;pedagogical agents;intelligent tutoring systems","","1","","12","IEEE","19 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) means the virtualization of telco network elements intending to get away from specialized or proprietary network appliances by leveraging standard IT virtualization technologies (clouds). One main intention of ETSI NFV MANO is controlling the NFV environment as much as possible through automation and orchestration. As security is a key requirement of virtual networking in the context of NFV environments, the same principles should apply to security management in ETSI NFV. Therefore it is proposed introducing a Security Orchestrator to meet this requirement. This paper describes the ETSI NFV Reference Architecture enhanced by the Security Orchestrator as well as the interworking of the Security Orchestrator with the already defined ETSI NFV orchestration and management entities like the NFV Orchestrator, the VNF Manager(s), the Element Manager(s) and the Virtual Infrastructure Manager(s).

In this paper, an improved lane recognition algorithm based on inverse perspective mapping (IPM) and edge image filtering was proposed to solve this issue. An aerial image of the original road scene could be obtained though IPM, which could significantly enhance the visual characteristics of the lane and reduce interference. An iterative clustering segmentation method was proposed to analyze the grayscale values of IPM gray image, and the gray points closest to the color and morphological features of the lane were retained as the lane edge in IPM image. Subsequently, a method that could search and determine the statistic of continuous edge regions was developed to segment the edge image. Filtering the interference factors was achieved by analyzing the edge points and retaining the longest regions. In comparison with other commonly used lane recognition algorithms, the result indicates that our method can more effectively filter all kinds of interference factors on the road and enhance the ability to detect fuzzy, real, virtual, and curved lanes under an environment with interference. This significantly improves the ability to keep to a lane under an autopilot environment. Because of this, lane recognition speed is greatly improved, which can meet the requirement of real-time autopilot.","2331-9569","978-1-6654-7911-0","10.1109/ICVR55215.2022.9848411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9848411","traffic engineering;multi-interference lane detection;adaptive lane edge extraction;filter of non-lane interference","Image segmentation;Visualization;Filtering;Image edge detection;Roads;Interference;Feature extraction","edge detection;feature extraction;image recognition;image segmentation;object detection;traffic engineering computing","multiinterference lane detection;edge image;visual based environment perception;navigation;inverse perspective mapping;aerial image;IPM gray image;lane edge;continuous edge regions;interference factors;edge points;lane recognition speed;iterative clustering segmentation","","","","26","IEEE","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We proposed two new network-aware placement algorithms which take into account users' locations in the network and connectivity at the autonomous system level to determine good sites for servers.

However, it’s indeed challenging. However, most existing image-based virtual trial room techniques combine both person and in-store clothes images without taking into consideration of mutual relation. An ideal process will not only change the target clothing into the best suitable shape but it will maintain the cloth uniqueness in the resulting image like color, shade, logos and texture of the material that represent the primary clothes. Prior Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approaches failed to achieve the above essential performance requirements for realistic virtual trial room performance because they do-not manage considerable spatial misalignment between the primary image and targeted cloth. We present a novel fully-learn-able 3D grid virtual trial room for overcoming all significant barriers in this project. In the first stage, it performs an affine transformation and then thin plate spline transformation for matching the in-store clothes to the target person’s body shape using the Geometry Matching Component. As a result, the warped clothes in the shop appear more realistic. We use Transformation Guided Component that generates a composition mask to blend the warped garments and the image produced is guarantee smoothness, which reduces borderline distortions of warped clothes and creates its outcomes more realistic. Numerous trials on the fashion data-set show that our model delivers decent performance in both qualitative and quantitative terms.","","978-1-6654-7988-2","10.1109/AIC55036.2022.9848947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9848947","2D images;3D Warped Grid;Virtual Trial room;Affine Transformation;Thin Plate Spline Transformation","Geometry;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Image color analysis;Computational modeling;Clothing","affine transforms;clothing;clothing industry;computer graphics;computer vision;feature extraction;grid computing;image registration;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical image processing;production engineering computing;splines (mathematics);virtual reality","warped clothes;image produced;numerous trials;3D grid;image based virtual trial room technologies;integrating modern in-store clothes;person image;multimedia;computer vision communities;existing image-based virtual trial room techniques;in-store clothes images;target clothing;cloth uniqueness;logos;texture;primary clothes;essential performance requirements;realistic virtual trial room performance;considerable spatial misalignment;primary image;targeted cloth;target person","","","","36","IEEE","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The virtual cloud essentially implements shared and coordinated task-spaces, which coordinates the scheduling of jobs submitted by a dynamic set of research groups to their local job queues. A policy-driven scheduling agent uses the QoS constraints along with performance history and the state of the resources to determine the appropriate size and mix of the public and private cloud resource that should be allocated to a specific request.

Three key requirements of realistic virtual humans in the virtual world have been identified, namely (1) autonomy: agents can function on their own, (2) interactivity: agents can interact naturally with players, and (3) personality: agents can exhibit human traits and characteristics. Working towards these challenges, we propose a brain-inspired agent architecture that integrates goal-directed autonomy, natural language interaction and human-like personality. We conducted an evaluative study involving human subjects to assess how virtual characters may enhance user experience in the virtual world.

RGB video drives modulators to impress information on Gaussian beams, which are optically combined to form full-color pixels of luminance and chromaticity determined by appropriate colorimetry. Typically, the pixel stream is fed into a single-mode optical fiber of length sufficient to dislocate the photonics/electronics package from the head worn scanning engine. There, the beam is air propagated to a focus lens, deflected into a raster format synchronized with the video, optically collimated, and combined with the viewer's visual field to achieve a spatially stabilized virtual image presentation. Multiple image-writing beams may be incorporated to increase the pixel count achieved with a given horizontal line scanner, designed to operate in air at resonant frequencies. Vertical refresh scanners are of sawtooth-driven servo type for progressive line scanning. The writing beam forms a narrow optical exit pupil which may serve as a viewer self-alignment feature in vision screening products such as an ophthalmic perimeter, or may be expanded to meet typical military aviation HMD requirements. A narrow exit pupil is relatively insensitive to a user's refractive errors or occluding media, making the VRD an inherently superior approach to low vision aiding.

A spatialization model of 3D Trees’ Elements in virtual forest environment is proposed, which includes the spatialization model of 3D Trees and solar radiation. Giving consideration to the single tree and trees group, the model focuses on the spatial form and distribution description of trees. The 3D trees modeling method, which combines the advantages of both L-systems and 3D geometry framework, is proposed base on rules. In the modeling method, branching laws, spatial distribution characteristics of leaves and tree configuration are changed into rules. Trees model is consistent with biophysical characteristics of trees. Moreover, according to the characteristics of solar radiation and the special requirements for radiation parameter calculation, the spatialization model of solar radiation is proposed, considering solar position parameters. Based on the idea of discretion, solar radiation in the local environment of trees is defined as ray model and beam model. Based on spatialization model of 3D trees and solar radiation, a fake-shadow method is proposed to calculate canopy radiation transmittance rate in the tree crown. The spatialization model and its application are realized by Visual C++ and OpenGL. This study has shown that the simulation of the canopy radiation transmittance is effective.

Proposed is a new approach to significantly limit the voltage overshoot and undershoot during load transient and reduce the number of capacitors, without compromising on the efficiency, cost or size of the DC/DC converter. It allow to optimize the power stage efficiency for the DC operation with less concern of dynamic performance, while an additional switching circuit; that utilizes the output capacitor current to detect load transient; is activated during load step up to deliver the shortage charge to the output capacitor, and also to pull out the extra charge from the output capacitor during load step down.

Customers are engaging in activities that overwhelm the network, which are driven by the application domains like: autonomous driving, virtual reality, and other smart city applications. Such varying demands need quick configuration response and elastic network re-sources. The enabling technologies like cloud computing, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Software Defined Networking (SDN), and their interplay enable the achievement of solutions to aforementioned problems. Virtualization of network infrastructures enables unique opportunities for operators to scale, utilize and automate their operations. These services should be managed and orchestrated in an efficient way. Management of virtual network functions needs to improve responsiveness by decreasing time to manage a network services. ETSI MANO is a standard architecture that defines network orchestration. Although there are a few Open-Source solutions available, they do not meet the requirements of orchestrating for specialized domains.

We have developed an architecture that allows changes to the grid configuration to be automated in response to operator input or sensors placed throughout the Grid. Additionally, our architecture allows the resource owner to specify who is allowed to alter the configuration of his resource and what types of reconfigurations are allowed.

Nowadays, mobile users possessing multi-homing mobile devices can have IP-connectivity almost everywhere, while being on the move. In terms of vertical handover, these users jump from a connectivity island to another that could differ by communication technology, access provider, QoS conditions and price. The mechanisms for vertical handover rely on broadcasted information or on QoS status of the wireless environment to comply with the applications requirements and user's preferences. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach to improve the accuracy and handiness of the network information typically used in the vertical handover solutions. Since the mobile users are not always on the move, we try to identify certain user states in a context-aware manner and trigger appropriated connectivity management tasks. While the user is on the move, we retrieve and store user's connectivity experiences through a route, aggregating time and location to represent a habit. Theses experiences are shared as feedback in virtual communities in order to reach potentially interested people who share similar movements.

Next to sound propagation and interaction with objects in the environment, the spatial directivity of the sound source and that of the receiver are important, including the human head and torso for headphone-based auralization. These directivities can be measured and represented by, e.g., head-related impulse responses (HRIRs). Particularly in interactive, real-time VAEs, considerable computational cost is required for interpolation and fast convolution with such directional filters. Approaches for simplifications exist including the approximation of the human head by a sphere. Here we suggest a unified structural approach to describe spatial directivity for sources and receivers including the human head with highly efficient low-order recursive filters. The filters are easily adjustable to match user requirements and are compared to the spatial directivity of the point source on a sphere and measured HRIRs. Perceptual evaluation showed good agreement with measured HRIRs.

In this paper, we propose techniques that work at two levels to address this problem. First the participants are grouped according to their virtual distance to satisfy their consistency requirements. Second, filters that combine application-level knowledge are utilized at boundary nodes to eliminate unnecessary message propagations.

We propose a method to address this issue by introducing a multiresolution modeling technique, where a reasonably coarse global model is locally enhanced using mesh subdivision and smoothening. The global model is based on a discretization of the boundary integral representation of the problem. The use of precomputation and structural reanalysis techniques result in a very rapid computation procedure. The local refinements are provided in the vicinity of the tool-tissue interaction area by adaptive subdivision of the boundary element mesh.

This area has provided convenience for many fields of practical applications, such as assistive systems and technology for people with severe disabilities, virtual reality, driver assistance and monitoring systems. Many methods for eye tracking have been introduced in literature. In this paper, a real-time eye tracking system is presented. To locate the iris of the eye in the captured video frames, the system uses the Circular Hough Transform which aims to recognize circular patterns in an image. Generally, the speed of eye motion is not as high as the used video frame rate of 30 Frames per Second (FPS) which is the frame rate used in general live video. In other words, the eye cannot move as fast as 30 motions per second. This led to proposing an enhancement to the eye tracking system being presented. This enhancement improved the CPU processing time requirements. The enhancement presented in this paper suggests that not all captured live video frames need to be processed for eye detection because the same eye movement will be captured on multiple subsequent video frames. Processing only a subset of frames will be enough to detect all eye movements in the video. The required CPU processing time is improved by selecting the minimum accepted video frame rate sufficient for accurately detecting all eye motions in a video. This was investigated for both the low and high speed eye movements. For low speed eye movements, the improvement in required CPU time was 1500%. For high speed eye movements, it was 750%. The improvement in CPU time is general and applies to different eye tracking algorithms when using the proposed enhancement. These improvements are a result of the elimination of the redundant video frames which are no longer processed in the procedure of eye detection.","","978-1-4673-6245-0","10.1109/LISAT.2013.6578214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578214","Eye tracking;eye motion speed;Real-time;Circular Hough Transform. frame rate","Transforms;Tracking;Real-time systems;Streaming media;Iris recognition;Human computer interaction;Image edge detection","eye;Hough transforms;human computer interaction;image enhancement;image motion analysis;iris recognition;object tracking;video signal processing","eye-gaze detection;eye-gaze tracking;human computer interaction;real-time eye tracking system;iris location;captured video frame rate;circular Hough transform;circular pattern recognition;eye motion speed;frame per second;FPS;CPU processing time requirements;eye movement;minimum accepted video frame rate selection;eye motion detection;redundant video frame elimination","","12","","16","IEEE","15 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) method is a major technique utilized in the Radio Frequency and microwave applications because of its exclusive band gap characteristics at a desired frequency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of different EBG structures used in the literature survey and analyzes the performance of the patch array using square and circular EBG between two patches. MC mainly arises when the surface currents on the patch antennas are excited, whenever the substrate εr > 1. These waves can be reduced by introducing EBG materials between patches on the substrate. By introducing these structures into the patch array various parameters like gain, bandwidth, directivity, radiation mechanism, current distribution in an antenna can be modified based on the user requirements. In this paper, different structures like square EBG with 6.3mm × 6.3mm and circular EBG with radius 3.15mm are investigated at UWB frequency range.","","978-1-5386-2369-5","10.1109/SPACES.2018.8316325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8316325","Microstrip patch;Electromagnetic band gap materials;Reflection phase;Dispersion diagram;Mushroom EBG;Defective Ground Structures;High Impedance Surface (HIS);Frequency Selective Surfaces;Split Ring Resonator (SRR);Mutual Coupling (MC)","Metamaterials;Antenna arrays;Surface waves;Resonant frequency;Surface impedance;Photonic band gap","antenna radiation patterns;microstrip antenna arrays;photonic band gap;ultra wideband antennas","modern antenna technology;Electromagnetic Band Gap method;microwave applications;exclusive band gap characteristics;patch array;circular EBG;patch antennas;EBG materials;square EBG;surface wave suppression;EBG structures;UWB frequency range;size 3.15 mm","","5","","29","IEEE","15 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The rapid proliferation of such IoMT devices can bring limitations to the current Cloud-IoT centric infrastructures which are not designed to handle huge volumes and velocity of data generated. To address this problem, it is necessary to revisit the network architecture, pushing some data, processing and services directly on the edge nodes of the network where the data originates, away from the centralized Cloud. In this context, Osmotic Computing (OC) aims to provide a new paradigm for the integration between a centralized Cloud layer and Edge/IoT layers. The deployment and migration strategies through the Cloud and Edge layers depend on the infrastructures and applications requirements. This scientific work promotes the basic principles behind the OC paradigm and proposes a closed-loop OC flow model applied to a gamified cognitive rehabilitation use case. Moreover, the use case introduces the development of a customized virtual reality system based on a serious game which allows the patient to carry out physical and cognitive rehabilitation therapies using a natural user interface based on Microsoft Kinect. eas.","","978-1-5386-9502-9","10.1109/CIC.2018.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8537865","osmotic-computing;cloud-computing;edge-computing;healthcare;IoMT;serious-games;gamification","Medical services;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Games;Computational modeling;Solid modeling","cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;user interfaces;virtual reality","Osmotic Computing;centralized Cloud layer;Edge/IoT layers;migration strategies;closed-loop OC flow model;physical rehabilitation;closed-loop gamified cognitive rehabilitation flow model;sweeping revolution;healthcare industry;IoMT devices;Internet of Medical Things;Cloud-IoT centric infrastructures;natural user interface;virtual reality system","","4","","24","IEEE","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

College Guide was developed as a guide for members and visitors to the College of Computer and Information Technology (CC&IT). The underlying technology upon which the application was based is augmented reality, which was used to enhance the quality and ease of use of the application, as users could get the information easily and contact others effectively. Five steps were carried out to develop the application: determine the problem and write the objectives and solution, analyze the system, gather requirements, design the interfaces, and implement the app. The results of using the system indicated that most users found it easy to use as the complete process included just three steps: open app, scan QR code, and show information. In addition, users found the design of the interfaces to be user-friendly, and no one suffered from using the application. Many users found it fun to use the augmented reality technique. Communication with staff was much faster than in the traditional way. In future work, we intend to extend the system to include all faculties and add more features, like 3D objects and live chat with the administration. We also want to involve the IT department in developing the application so that any faults can be reported and data updated directly.","","978-1-7281-4213-5","10.1109/ICCAIS48893.2020.9096723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096723","augmented reality;virtual reality;QR code","Augmented reality;Information technology;Global Positioning System;Cameras;Two dimensional displays;Tools","augmented reality;educational administrative data processing;educational institutions;mobile computing","mobile application;College Guide;campus guide;augmented reality techniques","","","","11","IEEE","20 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper reviews the processing architecture of the system, expanding on previous Experimental Virtual Archaeological Acoustics (EVAA) developments, and an objective level calibration performed for reproduction via headphones and a 32-channel loudspeaker array. A preliminary subjective evaluation was carried out with members of a medieval choir, having experience in Notre-Dame, concerning qualities of the rendering and the calibration procedure. Following the evaluation by this user group, revisions have been made to the rendering architecture with the goal of providing a real-time performance simulator for a four-member ensemble using an anechoic room and individual binaural renderings over open headphones. Further evaluations will concern relevance of additional modifications of the rendering system to improve realism, perception of architectural and acoustic changes related to the historic records of the space, and the impacts of these on musical performances of different genres and periods through objective and subjective analysis of the performances using the real-time auralization rendering system.","","978-1-6654-0998-8","10.1109/I3DA48870.2021.9610851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9610851","Heritage acoustics;room acoustics;performance evaluation;real-time auralization","Headphones;Loudspeakers;Three-dimensional displays;Music;Rendering (computer graphics);Numerical simulation;Real-time systems","acoustics;archaeology;architectural acoustics;calibration;headphones;hearing;loudspeakers;musical acoustics;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","calibration procedure;rendering architecture;binaural renderings;rendering system;musical performance;objective analysis;subjective analysis;choir members;heritage acoustics studies;prerecorded source material;numerical simulation;heritage spaces;processing architecture;objective level calibration;loudspeaker array;preliminary subjective evaluation;medieval choir;virtual notre-dame;preliminary results;auralization architecture;listeners perspective;experimental virtual archaeological acoustics developments;EVAA developments;open headphones","","","","45","IEEE","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some techniques have been proposed by utilizing wearable devices, however, existing systems typically require precise and continuous time-series data at every single timestep for calibration, which largely increases the burden to users. Therefore, we propose a novel posing-based detection method through measuring muscle deformation, which only requires arbitrary and discrete posture data for calibration without walking. In this study, we firstly collected the posing data as the training set and gait data as the test set from participants through a FirstVR device. Then the Support Vector Machine was trained to be a two-class classifier of heel-contact and non-heel-contact phases by using the collected muscle deformation data during posing. Finally we propose an efficient evaluation system by taking advantage of OpenPose to automatically label our continuous gait data. Experimental results demonstrate the muscle deformation sensor could correctly detect heel-contact with approximately 80% accuracy during walking, which shows the feasibility of posing-based method with muscle deformation information for heel-contact detection.","","978-1-7281-6321-5","10.1109/ROBIO49542.2019.8961661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8961661","","","gait analysis;medical signal detection;muscle;patient monitoring;patient rehabilitation;pose estimation;support vector machines;virtual reality","heel-contact gait phase detection;quantitative evaluation;synchronous robotic assistance;human walking;rehabilitation training;human motion state;heel-contact detection;gait cycle;gait analysis applications;wearable devices;continuous time-series data;arbitrary posture data;discrete posture data;nonheel-contact phases;continuous gait data;muscle deformation sensor;posing-based detection method;support vector machine;FirstVR device","","4","","27","IEEE","20 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a broadband wireless multimedia network such as wireless ATM, an effective MAC protocol is very much desired because efficient allocation of channel bandwidth is imperative in accommodating a large user population with satisfactory quality of service. Indeed, MAC protocols for a wireless ATM network, in which user traffic requirements are highly heterogeneous (classified into CBR, VBR, and ABR), are even more intricate to design. Considerable research efforts expended in tackling the problem have resulted in a myriad of MAC protocols. While each protocol is individually shown to be effective by the respective designers, it is unclear how these different protocols compare against each other on a unified basis. We quantitatively compare seven previously proposed TDMA-based MAC protocols for integrated wireless data and voice services. We first propose a taxonomy of TDMA-based protocols, from which we carefully select seven protocols, namely SCAMA, DTDMA/VR, DTDMA/PR, D4RUMA, DPRMA, DSA++, and PRMA/DA, such that they are devised based on rather orthogonal design philosophies.

In such situations, the object could be tracked through non-geometric means, such as heat, radioactivity, or other markers. In order to safely explore a region, we use an optical time-of-flight pretouch sensor to detect (and range) target objects prior to contact. Information from these sensors is presented to the user via haptic virtual fixtures. This combination of techniques allows the teleoperator to “feel” the object without an actual contact event between the robot and the target object. Thus it provides the perceptual benefits of touch interaction to the operator, without incurring the negative consequences of the robot contacting unknown geometrical structures; premature contact can lead to damage or unwanted displacement of the target. The authors propose that as the geometry of the scene transitions from completely unknown to partially explored, haptic virtual fixtures can both prevent collisions and guide the user towards areas of interest, thus improving exploration speed. Experimental results show that for situations that are not amenable to vision, haptically-presented pretouch sensor information allows operators to more effectively explore moving objects.","","978-1-7281-0377-8","10.1109/ROBIO.2018.8665228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8665228","","Robot sensing systems;Haptic interfaces;Optical sensors;Geometry;Biomedical optical imaging","collision avoidance;control engineering computing;haptic interfaces;sensors;telerobotics;user interfaces;virtual reality","nongeometric means;optical time-of-flight pretouch sensor;target object;haptic virtual fixtures;teleoperator;actual contact event;unknown geometrical structures;premature contact;partially explored fixtures;exploration speed;haptically-presented pretouch sensor information;visionless tele-exploration;3d moving objects;improved teleoperation;dynamic environments;maneuverability requirements","","10","","30","IEEE","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the development of the Internet of Things and widespread smart home, there are many Internet-enabled services in smart homes. Each kind of service has distinct service quality requirements. Remote disaster warning and remote monitoring and detection service emphasize realtime and reliability. UHD video (4K/8K) and VR /AR services require high transmission bandwidth. As the number of IoT-enabled equipment of smart homes increases, it becomes imperative to effectively allocate limited bandwidth resources and improve the overall network performance to ensure the effectiveness of various services. From the perspective of Internet service providers (ISP), this research studied deep reinforcement learning techniques cooperating with software-defined networks (SDN) to improve traditional smart homes' bandwidth management architecture and bandwidth allocation method. The SDN architecture separates the control plane and the data plane. It centralizes the control mechanism to simplify and support flexible network management. Deep reinforcement learning does not rely on labeled data instead of exploring the unknown environment and the environment's feedback on current as the basis for the subsequent action. This study used SDN to simulate the network environment from smart homes to an ISP. Due to the lack of a sufficient amount of labeled data, and it is not easy to establish a standard for data labeling, we used the Deep Q-network (DQN) of deep reinforcement learning in the bandwidth allocation for smart homes. The simulation results show that Deep Q-network can achieve high performance in both the jitter reduction ratio and the probability of successfully fulfilling bandwidth allocation termination conditions.","2644-3163","978-1-6654-0066-4","10.1109/IEMCON53756.2021.9623084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623084","Deep Q-Network;Bandwidth Allocation;Smart Home","Simulation;Web and internet services;Smart homes;Reinforcement learning;Bandwidth;Channel allocation;Service-oriented architecture","bandwidth allocation;computer network management;home automation;home computing;Internet;Internet of Things;reinforcement learning;software defined networking","high transmission bandwidth;smart homes increases;Internet service providers;traditional smart homes;bandwidth allocation method;deep reinforcement learning;network environment;deep Q-network;bandwidth allocation termination conditions;convenient living environment;safe living environment;high-tech home appliances;network services;widespread smart home;Internet-enabled services;distinct service quality requirements;remote monitoring;reliability;deep Q- network","","","","6","IEEE","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we explore VHE aspects and scenarios with the aim of introducing service outsourcing. We extend our earlier work on service outsourcing to VHE where services are outsourced to a candidate network if the custodian visited network cannot meet critical VHE requirements for a user.

In this paper, for client-server architecture we present a game state forwarding mechanism supportive for online games that can comply strict time-constraint. The objective is to reduce latency between two players by directly sharing game states rather than following a comparatively lengthy path using the server. The quality control, a key requirement for online games though subjective, is a challenging task. For this reason, game providers add enormous amount of resource into systems to maintain the desired level of gaming experience. In this article, we also introduce a quality control algorithm considering the significance of virtual interaction and players' physical position. Our assumption states that the interaction detail between two players is inversely proportional to their virtual distance. Based on this principle and the time- constraint of the target application, a quality precedence matrix is formed augmenting gaming experience. Desired performance improvement has been observed while conducting the simulation.","2159-1520","978-1-4244-7713-5","10.1109/EMC.2010.5575766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5575766","","Games;Servers;Quality control;Delay;Approximation methods;Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth","client-server systems;computer games;quality control;virtual reality","quality control algorithm;virtual distance;client server architecture;online game;game logic;game state forwarding mechanism;time constraint;latency reduction;virtual interaction;player physical position;quality precedence matrix","","1","","13","IEEE","16 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the technologies become more mainstream, the remaining open question is how to interact with such hybrid workstations that combine 2D views displayed on a physical monitor and 3D views displayed on a HoloLens. For a selection task, we compared mouse-based interaction (standard for 2D desktop workstations) and direct touch interaction in mid-air (standard for 3D AR) while considering different positions of the 3D scene according to a physical monitor. To extend mouse-based selection to 3D views, we experimentally explored different interaction metaphors where the mouse cursor moves either on a horizontal or a vertical plane in a 3D virtual scene. To check for ecological validity of our results, we conducted an additional study focusing on interaction with a 2D/3D Gapminder dataset visualization. The results show 1) that the mouse-based interaction, as compared to direct touch interaction in mid-air, is easy and efficient, 2) that using a vertical plane placed in front of the 3D virtual scene to mimic the double screen metaphor outperforms other interaction techniques and 3) that flexibility is required to allow users to choose the selection techniques and to position the 3D virtual scene relative to the physical monitor. Based on these results, we derive interaction design guidelines for hybrid workstations.","1554-7868","978-1-6654-5325-7","10.1109/ISMAR55827.2022.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9995594","Human-centered computing;Visualization;Interaction techniques;Hybrid 2D/3D workstation;AR","Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Stereo image processing;Resists;Mice;Workstations;Task analysis","augmented reality;data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;handicapped aids;helmet mounted displays;mouse controllers (computers);virtual reality","2D desktop workstations;3D stereoscopic views;3D virtual scene;Augmented Reality Head-Mounted Display;different interaction metaphors;direct touch interaction;flexible display spaces;hybrid workstations;interaction design guidelines;interaction techniques;mouse cursor;mouse-based interaction;mouse-based selection;physical monitor;physical space requirements;selection task;selection techniques;standard desktop workstation;virtual scenes","","","","38","IEEE","27 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Towards that Design and fabricated ICSTSWH. Solar heat gain has been enhanced by means of saw tooth shape roof which have maximum transmissivity to collect the solar irradiation. Top layer is made up of a double layer glass glazing where heat transfer analysis is done for different mediums like hydrogen, oxygen and vacuum gas. Storage tank is completely insulated except saw tooth portion. The bottom portion of the glass is coated with black color for making the absorbance co-efficient close to one. 20 aluminum pipes of 1mm thick are fixed in parallel and filled with Paraffin wax [C12] which stores the thermal energy in the form of latent heat. The PCM material gets charged when there is available of solar radiation and discharges whenever the source is not there. The trapezoidal shape solar thermal energy storage system provides energy saving which depends predominately on the amount of thermal stratification within the saw tooth storage cavity. This design brings on thermal stratification in the water storage, and provides enough energy storage to meet the hot water requirements between 6 am to 8 am (early morning) in institution's hostels.","","978-1-5090-3498-7","10.1109/SGBC.2016.7936078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7936078","Integrated collector-storage;solar water heater;Saw tooth;PCM;Insulation","Water heating;Phase change materials;Solar heating;Solar radiation;Temperature measurement;Glass","energy conservation;heat transfer;phase change materials;solar absorber-convertors;solar heating;thermal energy storage;water storage;waxes","solar thermal energy storage;PCM based integrated saw tooth collector;phase change material;integrated collector-saw tooth solar water heating system;ICSTSWH system;solar heat gain;saw tooth shape roof;double layer glass glazing;heat transfer analysis;storage tank;paraffin wax;latent heat;thermal energy;trapezoidal shape solar thermal energy storage system;energy saving;thermal stratification;solar irradiation collection","","2","","10","IEEE","1 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the injuries caused by the colonoscope during the operation, and the long time spent at the hospital by the patient, we focus on a new type of intelligent colonoscope. The main purpose of this medical tool is to be in accordance with MS by minimizing the contact between the colonoscope and the interior boundary of the colon, and to make the progression of the colonoscope easier for the surgeon. Our current prototype, which is twice the size of the final tool, is electro-pneumatically driven.

Unfortunately, the geolocation of cloud data centers could be insufficient to satisfy the latency aimed for in 5G networks. Driven by these application requirements, there is a big paradigm shift in mobile computing, from cloud computing to edge computing by offloading the computing, application task, and storage to an edge server. Edge computing promises a dramatic reduction in latency by locating servers closer to the devices that will connect to them.

While we speak of real-time volume rendering for visualization, we are still very much limited to Surface models for manipulation due to overwhelming computational requirements for volumetric models. In this paper, we propose a new volumetric deformable model that is suitable for volume haptic interactions. The volume elements of our proposed model are linked to their nearest neighbors and their displacements are transformed into potential energy of the virtual object. The original 3D ChainMail algorithm does not account the fact that the residual energy left in the object after some interactions becomes a critical problem in haptic rendering. We present the shape-retaining chain linked model, which allows for fast and realistic deformation of elastic objects. Furthermore, we incorporate force-voltage analogy (duality) concepts into the proposed shape-retaining chain linked representation in order to develop a fast volumetric haptic model that is Suitable for realtime applications.

Such process has been anticipated by the introduction of the Nintendo Wii that, within a few months from its launch, stably reached the top ranking of sales among gaming systems. We can expect something similar will occur once the for-long expected Microsoft Kinect system will be available on the shelves of computer gaming stores. In general, it is clear from this sequence of events, that the opportunity of playing a game naturally, performing the same movements that would be made in a real setting, has a magnetic effect on customers. What, instead, is less evident is the great wealth of research that has been performed in the recent years to reach such result. In fact, behind the development of such gaming platforms strenuous research efforts have been made in a number of areas, which include and are not limited to hand following techniques and gesture recognition algorithms. As a beneficial side effect, the development of these areas can also play an important role in a number of other applications, including technical and artistic interactive exhibitions. In this paper we will describe the process that led us to devise a novel hand following and an innovative gesture recognition technique that both can easily be applied to exhibition scenarios (e.g., museums, fairs, etc.) and in general all those performing events where a pre-defined set of gestures are needed to enjoy a cultural experience, as they can be easily jointly put to good use to recognize a predefined set of movements.

Understanding of the requirements and design processes necessary to support these new technologies is still emerging. While the gaming community has developed heuristics for game design over a 25 year period, the adaptation of this knowledge for the design of virtual collaboration spaces has been limited. Following a research through design approach, we create novel integrations and applications of Human Computer Interaction research methods in an attempt to understand the collaborative work of a small group of individuals in a 3 dimensional virtual world. Specifically, the fine grained perspective provided by eye-tracking (ET), and a more coarse unit of analysis, provided by All-Views-Qualitative-Analysis (AVQA), are applied to understand non-gaming interaction in 3 dimensional virtual worlds. To formalize an integrated method, we describe three lenses for analyzing eye-tracking data in graphics intensive and animated virtual applications. Then, we combine those outcomes with a single method for integrating and analyzing the points-of-view of all subjects in a small group collaborating on a creative work task in a 3 dimensional virtual world. Through these examples, we illustrate the benefits of this type of research for 3 dimensional virtual world designers.","1530-1605","978-1-4244-5510-2","10.1109/HICSS.2010.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5428712","","Collaborative work;Human computer interaction;Space technology;Collaboration;Process design;Application software;Lenses;Data analysis;Graphics;Animation","common-sense reasoning;groupware;human computer interaction;solid modelling;tracking;virtual reality","assessing multiple perspectives;three dimensional virtual worlds;eye tracking;all views qualitative analysis;human computer interaction;interaction design;gaming community;design processes;virtual collaboration spaces;collaborative work;virtual world designers","","2","","41","IEEE","11 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The emergence of high speed visible light communication (VLC) offers an opportunity to mitigate the looming spectrum crisis. However, the power consumption of a VLC link due to incoherent transmission is a major concern for system designers. Only a few studies have addressed this issue. In this paper, a theoretical study on the relationship between the power consumption and the data rate of a high speed VLC link is presented. The considered VLC link is based on direct-current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO - OFDM) and on-off keying (OOK). The effects of spatial modulation (SM) are also investigated. The presented results show that the optimal operating bandwidth can be determined for a SM DCO-OFDM system to achieve the highest power efficiency possible. The study provides a guideline to configure a VLC system in order to optimize power efficiency for different data rate requirements.","2576-6813","978-1-5386-4727-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8647711","","Power demand;Light emitting diodes;Optical transmitters;Bandwidth;Modulation;Lenses;Radio frequency","free-space optical communication;OFDM modulation;telecommunication traffic","high speed visible light communication systems;wireless data traffic;mobile traffic demand;virtual reality;high speed VLC link;SM DCO-OFDM system;VLC system;power consumption;direct-current-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;power efficiency","","6","","20","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, considering the requirements of real-time detection, the amplitude and frequency of the high frequency drive signal are optimized by the knowledge-based particle swarm optimization (KPSO), which takes the mean signal-noise-ratio (MSNR) of output as the fitness function, and the property that VR system produces the best resonance effect just when the valid system parameter â(B,Ω) is greater than zero as knowledge. Finally, the parameter compensation is combined to achieve multi-high frequency weak signals detection with a stable noise.

With the developments of versatile Internet applications, the QoS requirements can be very different. For example, new-age applications such as AR/VR can be quite sensitive to even millisecond delays. End-to-end transaction latency in blockchain is a critical factor that affects the performance of DApps. It is the time duration from sending out a transaction (from the client) to having the transaction recorded on the chain. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the end-to-end latency in Ethereum and discuss the factors that may affect latency on the Ethereum main-net.

Even though virtual network function (VNF) sharing is known to improve the utilization of the service providers’ resources, service requests -including time-sensitive ones- can nevertheless be rejected. This paper proposes PSVS: a Prediction-based Service placement scheme with VNF Sharing at the edge. PSVS utilizes the predicted required resources in a defined lookahead window to minimize the rejection rate of premium services.

Based on the binary description algorithm ORB, the algorithm constructs a pyramid-like scale space, and detects oFAST key points on each layer to improve the scale invariance of the algorithm. In terms of descriptors, the 128-bit improved FREAK description operator is used instead of the last 128 bits of the small variance in the rBRIEF description operator, which makes full use of image information to improve the matching accuracy and robustness. The experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper has greatly improved the feature matching rate and robustness in terms of scale change, rotation, and brightness change compared with the traditional ORB, and meets the requirements for fast and accurate matching of complex images.","","978-1-7281-4323-1","10.1109/ITOEC49072.2020.9141770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9141770","slam;orb;feature detection;scale invariance;descriptor","Feature extraction;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Robustness;Detection algorithms;Visualization;Information technology;Real-time systems","feature extraction;image matching;robot vision;SLAM (robots)","traditional ORB;ORB feature matching algorithm;fusion descriptor;visual SLAM;virtual reality;robot positioning;feature detection;feature matching technology;high mismatch rate;binary description algorithm;improved ORB feature;pyramid-like scale space;scale invariance;FREAK description operator;rBRIEF description operator;matching accuracy;feature matching rate;fast complex image matching;oFAST key point detection;oriented fast and rotated brief;large scale matching error;word length 128.0 bit","","5","","14","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to meet these expectations, IC need to design low or ultra-low current (nA~μA), low clock speed and command simplification, etc., however, for these milliseconds or microseconds signals, more complicated operation modes and rapid switching frequency, the traditional temperature measurement cannot accurately measure the instantaneous temperature variations. If the temperature rising is evaluated by transient thermal simulation, the correct model size and material characteristics such as density and specific heat are required, but it's difficult to find the correct material information for multiple material, for example: plating material trace on silicon die, substrate and PCC, etc. Therefore, temperature variations in transient simulation cannot be correctly analyzed. This paper evaluates the difference of thermal resistance measurement between JEDEC traditional measurement method and TDIM (Transient Dual Interface Measurement) in QFN and HFCBGA, and compares the difference and causes of the results under different measurement environments. In addition, TDIM can evaluate the thermal resistance of each structural layer and also measure the instantaneous variations in temperature and thermal resistance. Finally, the transient thermal model can be provided after correction with simulation software to ensure that the transient simulation result is better and more accurate. The results show that the difference between TDIM and traditional method isn't significant when the heating power is smaller; the larger heating power cause the difference is increases significantly to more than 10%. Through the process of structure function can find out that defects in the heat path may cause large thermal resistance. The corrected thermal model can be closer to the real measurement result in the transient analysis, and also significant difference in system level thermal simulation.","","978-1-7281-5064-2","10.1109/ICEPT47577.2019.245813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081060","thermal resistance;TDIM;QFN;HFCBGA;structure function;system level","","ball grid arrays;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit modelling;integrated circuit packaging;low-power electronics;temperature measurement;thermal management (packaging);thermal resistance measurement;transient analysis","Transient thermal resistance analysis;IC packages;next-generation 5G mobile network causes;handheld device;wearable devices;electric vehicles;smart home system;power consumption;clock speed;microseconds signals;switching frequency;temperature measurement;transient thermal simulation;material characteristics;specific heat;thermal resistance measurement;JEDEC traditional measurement method;TDIM;Transient Dual Interface Measurement;transient thermal model;simulation software;transient analysis;system level thermal simulation;QFN;HFCBGA;plating material trace;silicon die","","4","","8","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This editing is performed in a way that leaves the resulting stream consistent with the MPEG-2 standard. We currently reduce the transmission of data by skipping macroblocks or deleting DCT coefficients outside the region of interest in P and B pictures, and deleting DCT coefficients in I frames. This results in a savings of approximately 50% of the bandwidth of the original stream for our application. Since we are transmitting four video streams to the surrogate over our wireless network, the total bandwidth is reduced by about 5 Mbit/s.

There are various commercial application frameworks to support services necessary for tactical simulations such as building scenarios and simulation of forces. However, those frameworks are not always able to meet the needs of algorithmic behaviors simulation. The integration of simulation tools developed for the requirements of algorithmic behavior simulation with control interfaces and CGF applications based on commercial frameworks appears as a crucial problem. Coordination among different infrastructures throughout the same application must be maintained for critical control behaviors like scenario management and run control. To realize these aims, using customized commercial control architecture or developing an original architecture are two significant methods. In this study, the two methods proposed above have been compared. The second method is claimed to be more advantageous since it provides modularity, reusability and isolation from the commercial application. This method has been used in the simulation application to develop an HLA (High-Level Architecture) and RPR-FOM (Real-Time Platform-Level Reference Federation Object Model) compliant simulation control architecture. This architecture has been tested by using VR-Forces based control interface and CGF applications along with federates where algorithmic behaviors are simulated. The proposed control architecture can easily be utilized for the management of heterogeneous simulation applications under the same standards such as HLA or DIS.","","978-1-4244-7783-8","10.1109/SIMUL.2010.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5601886","HLA;VR-Forces;Distributed Simulation;Vr-Link;Heterogeneous Simulation System","Graphical user interfaces;Load modeling;Computer architecture;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Control systems","digital simulation;military communication;military computing","simulation system;military training;algorithmic behavior;simulation tool;scenario management;run control;HLA;high level architecture;RPR-FOM;real time platform level reference federation object model;simulation control architecture;VR-forces based control interface;CGF application;computer generated forces","","1","","14","IEEE","14 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the requirement for lower time costs and fewer memory costs for mobile robot applications is not well satisfied. In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection framework titled FILD’ (Fast and Incremental Loop closure Detection), which focuses on an on-line and incremental graph vocabulary construction for fast loop closure detection. The global and local features of frames are extracted using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and SURF on the GPU, which guarantee extremely fast extraction speeds. The graph vocabulary construction is based on one type of proximity graph, named Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs, which is modified to adapt to this specific application. In addition, this process is coupled with a novel strategy for real-time geometrical verification, which only keeps binary hash codes and significantly saves on memory usage. Extensive experiments on several publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach can achieve fairly good recall at 100% precision compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

With the need of highly reliable processes, the semiconductor industry is interested in developing methodologies covering the gap of missing metrology information. Virtual Metrology (VM) turns out to be a promising method; it aims to predict wafer and/or site fine metrology results in real time and free of costs. Using virtual measurements as the input of a sampling decision system (SDS), an optimal strategy for measuring productive wafers can be suggested. Since sampling decisions strongly depend on the accuracy of the VM system, it is a key requirement to monitor the reliability of the obtained predictions. In this paper, we present approaches for dynamically assessing VM reliability using real metrology data. A Bayesian dynamical linear model (BDLM) handles increasing VM model uncertainty over time. Model parameters are updated whenever new real measurements become available. VM prediction quality is monitored applying a probability integral transform (PIT) and scoring rules for predictive probability distributions. Inferring equipment health factors (EHF), unreliable predictions can be detected before being delivered to the SDS. Based on the likelihood of the predicted measurements, VM trust factors are introduced. A Bayesian model for the prediction precision matrix allows updating the virtual measurements' uncertainty whenever real measurements are available. Taking account of the proposed methods, one is led to an improved accuracy of the SDS.","2161-8089","978-1-4799-1515-6","10.1109/CoASE.2013.6653949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6653949","","Semiconductor device measurement;Predictive models;Metrology;Computational modeling;Covariance matrices;Integrated circuits;Reliability","Bayes methods;measurement;production engineering computing;reliability;sampling methods;semiconductor device manufacture;statistical distributions;transforms;virtual reality","virtual metrology reliability monitoring;sampling decision system;VM reliability assessment;Bayesian dynamical linear model;BDLM;VM model uncertainty;VM prediction quality;probability integral transform;PIT;predictive probability distributions;equipment health factors;EHF;SDS;VM trust factors;prediction precision matrix;virtual measurements uncertainty;semiconductor manufacturing","","8","1","6","IEEE","7 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the case of microsurgeries, the procedures suffer from susceptibility to variation in surgeon skill and equipment characteristics. This paper presents a novel, computer-assisted surgical interface for laser-based microsurgeries, called the “μRALP Surgical System”. With the system, surgeries can be performed with improved safety and precision using a three-part architecture: (i) a 3D viewer device providing stereoscopic visualization; (ii) a graphics stylus that controls a motorized micromanipulator for laser aiming and activation; and (iii) a configuration interface allowing system setup and modifications in real-time. The system combines the advantages of a computer-assisted platform while respecting the visualization and manipulation requirements of a microsurgical procedure. The features include intraoperative planning for automatic laser incisions and ablations as well as safety regions based on virtual overlays in the surgeon's field-of-view. A comparative evaluation of the proposed system against the traditional system points to the clear superiority of the new interface. The quantitative comparison shows that the proposed interface is safer, more precise, and better controlled. The qualitative comparison demonstrates that the interface is easier to use, easier to learn, and has a minimal training requirement.

Recently, virtual clusters try either to virtualize a single physical cluster into multiple independent virtual clusters to provide a virtual server as a highly scalable and highly available server built on a cluster of real servers, or to share physical clusters to offer economies of scale and more effective use of resources by multiplexing. However, since programs running on a cluster demonstrate different types of requirements as their executions proceeds, such as support for intensive processing, security, and massive data communications, it is therefore quite unrealistic to assume that a statically configured cluster with a predetermined number of nodes with specific features and support can do any good for such programs. This paper presents a different usage for virtualization in the context of distributed computing using virtual clusters, called virtual cluster engine (VCE), that provides a computing environment that can be both statistically and dynamically (re)organized according to the needs and requirements of programs, so that they can achieve the best possible performance as they suit themselves, indeed within the constraints of available resources. Feasibility of the proposed architecture for VCE has been studied on an experimental platform using seven real machines, VMWare ESX, VMotion, and VMWare programming kit, and a number of virtual machines.

On the other hand, the performance of UE is rapidly improving with abundant resources for enabling local data processing. In this paper, we rethink the benefits of MEC by first arguing these benefits are myths, that is, the advancement of UE may defeat the often-assumed benefits of MEC, i.e., offloading computation and reducing latency, and then demystify the myths by carefully summarizing the latency and computational requirements of the existing applications possibly benefiting from MEC by surveying several tens of publications while examining the recent UEs performance improvement. We also attempt to undercover new benefits of MEC. In the light of these observations, we conclude that MEC is not necessarily just required for low-latency and computationally intensive applications, but also brings benefits from the four additional perspectives: (1) Data Scalability, (2) Application Scalability, (3) Intent-driven Networking, (4) Partial offloading of the network functions.","","978-1-5386-6831-3","10.1109/CloudNet.2018.8549539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8549539","Mobile Edge Computing","Scalability;Machine learning;Performance evaluation;Task analysis;Cloud computing;Mobile handsets","cloud computing;distributed processing;mobile computing;multi-access systems;synchronisation;vehicular ad hoc networks","MEC;offloading intense computation;connected car;edge cloud;local data processing;mobile-multiaccess edge computing;UE performance improvement","","3","","31","IEEE","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our system is split into different subsystems: interactions, task logic, messages,scoring and feedback. This way, therapists specify the requirements of each subsystem separately, which comes out to be easier and clearer. The game structure manages and composes the input and output of the different subsystems to run the game. All the interactions are specified according to a common syntax. This provides the desired flexibility to add, remove and modify interactions in run-time. In order to control the location of all the objects of the scenario, for each receiver surface, we define a pick-and-place grid that keeps record of the objects piled onto it. The game logic is implemented as a non-deterministic automaton that controls each task state, modifies in run-time the different subsystems and programs new interactions.Moreover, we have designed a graphical editor to describe the game logic in a simple way, focusing only on relevant states of the application.","","978-1-4244-6332-9","10.1109/VS-GAMES.2010.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459947","virtual rehabilitation;virtual environments","Game theory;Computer graphics;Virtual environment;Automatic control;Application software;Logic;Neurofeedback;Runtime;Military computing;Biomedical engineering","computer games;medical computing;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality","3D virtual environment;neuropsychological rehabilitation activities;cognitive impairments;task functioning;interactions subsystem;task logic subsystem;messages subsystem;scoring subsystem;feedback subsystem;pick-and-place grid;game logic;nondeterministic automaton","","6","","29","IEEE","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem has been traditionally limited to optimally assigning switches to static physical controllers and placing those controllers over a network topology. However, virtualized controllers in place of physical ones could largely increase the dynamism in network control. In such a scenario, provisioning the requirements of the controllers themselves as virtual entities is also important. The virtual controllers may be inter-connected to each other via virtual controller-controller links and require additional virtualized support functions such as databases, to form a complete distributed virtual control plane. In this paper, we refer to the virtual control plane as the virtual control graph. This virtual control graph needs to be provisioned in addition to the traditional assignment of switches to controllers. Furthermore, all previous work assumes the control link between the switches and the controllers that control them can be created irrespective of the location of those controllers. This is untrue in a virtualized environment where the virtual control graph would connect to as well as control the very network they are provisioned on, using in band control channels. This switch to controller path must explicitly be provisioned in band and controller placement mechanisms must take into account the requirements of such provisioning algorithm as well. This paper proposes an extensible ILP model which addresses these two problems to enable the provisioning of virtual control graphs while also addressing the traditional requirements of controller placement. We then validate the proposed model with extensive simulations. The evaluation results show that this model can help address our considerations and can be applied to real world virtual controller graph placement scenarios.","","978-1-5386-2784-6","10.1109/INFCOMW.2017.8116461","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8116461","","Control systems;Conferences;Delays;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Substrates;Artificial neural networks","computational complexity;graph theory;integer programming;linear programming;optimisation;quality of service;resource allocation;software defined networking;telecommunication control;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;virtual reality;virtualisation","virtual control graph;control link;band control channels;controller path;world virtual controller graph placement scenarios;virtualized control plane placement problem;controller placement problem;static physical controllers;network control;virtual controller-controller links;additional virtualized support functions;complete distributed virtual control plane","","1","","12","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Correct mutual occlusion between real and virtual objects is often necessary for displaying realistic virtual images for users in the AR application scenarios. Some optical designs have been proposed to realize mutual occlusion by means of an OSTHMD in recent years. However, all of them support a limited field of view (FOV) that is much narrower than that of a natural human. The main limiting factor of the FOV of general OSTHMDs is the limited numerical aperture (NA) of the lenses. To address the problem, we propose an OSTHMD based on the double ellipsoidal mirror structure to avoid a stack of lenses and to achieve a wide FOV close to that of the naked eye with small distortion. A pair of imaging lenses are carefully arranged, then assembled between the two ellipsoidal mirrors with a pinhole mask to improve image quality. An experiment using a monocular prototype shows that a sharp see through view is achieved which remains clear regardless of the focus of the eye-simulating camera. An image undistortion algorithm is also developed to obtain a full-view display, enabling a virtual image to be displayed spanning a super wide FOV of H160°×V74°. Finally, per-pixel mutual occlusion of a wide FOV of H122°×V74° is realized by placing a spatial light modulator (SLM) in front of the entrance pupil.","1554-7868","978-1-7281-8508-8","10.1109/ISMAR50242.2020.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284767","Computing methodologies;Computer graphics;Graphics system and interface-Mixed/Augmented reality","Optical design;Prototypes;Optical distortion;Optical imaging;Mirrors;Optical sensors;Lenses","augmented reality;cameras;helmet mounted displays;image processing;lenses;mirrors;optical design techniques;optical images;spatial light modulators;virtual reality","augmented reality;digital world;virtual objects;realistic virtual images;optical designs;numerical aperture;double ellipsoidal mirror structure;imaging lenses;image quality;eye-simulating camera;image undistortion algorithm;full-view display;per-pixel mutual occlusion;optical see-through head mounted displays;mutual occlusion correction;spatial light modulator;entrance pupil","","2","","43","IEEE","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the above phenomenon, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been suggested to bring cloud resources, such as computation and storage resources, to the edge network. Now, MEC is considered as a good method to reduce the workload on the cloud server and to reduce response time for mobile users. In this paper, the definition of the MEC is presented.

In a platooning scenario, when a pedestrian is detected by a CAV, the leader CAV shares the information with its followers to provide a safe and courteous environment thanks to its connectivity. However, the possibility to improve traffic efficiency while meeting the safety requirements has rarely been addressed in current research. Yet, in industrial areas, where automated vehicles and pedestrians frequently interact, combining safety and efficiency is crucial. The present paper addresses this challenge by first analyzing the intersection of CAVs and pedestrians in no-traffic-signal scenarios. The optimal state is proposed to reduce the time loss.

Depends on the applications, it could be used by different age group, in different environmental conditions and may be used for a dozen of minutes to even a few hours. The HBSE (Hazard-based safety engineering) standard IEC 62368–1 is applicable to the safety of electrical and electronic equipment within the field of audio, video, information and communication technology, including HMDs. In this study, we discussed IEC 62368–1 requirements for HMDs. Then we identified possible hazards of HMDs with reference to IEC Guide 104 and risk assessment standards ISO 12100 and EN Guide 32. After that, we identified possible hazards and provided recommendations based on the existing research. We limited the scope on the consumer-grade HMDs only due to page restrictions. Possible hazards occur in other domains/ applications may need more supporting reference and will be the future work.","","978-1-6654-4342-5","10.1109/ISPCE-ASIA53453.2021.9652181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9652181","Head-Mounted Display;HMD;Hazards;Hazard identification","Head-mounted displays;ISO Standards;Resists;Glass;Hazards;Information and communication technology;Risk management","health hazards;helmet mounted displays;IEC standards;ISO standards;occupational safety;risk management","communication technology;IEC 62368-1 requirements;possible hazards;IEC Guide 104;assessment standards;consumer-grade HMDs;Hazard identification;consumer-grade head-Mounted displays;Head-Mounted Display;display devices;age group;HBSE standard IEC 62368-1;Hazard-based safety engineering;electrical equipment;electronic equipment","","","","42","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, we propose X-Section, an RGB-D 3D reconstruction approach that leverages deep learning to make object-level predictions about thicknesses that can be readily integrated into a volumetric multi-view fusion process, where we propose an extension to the popular KinectFusion approach. In essence, our method allows to complete shape in general indoor scenes behind what is sensed by the RGB-D camera, which may be crucial e.g.\ for robotic manipulation tasks or efficient scene exploration. Predicting object thicknesses rather than volumes allows us to work with comparably high spatial resolution without exploding memory and training data requirements on the employed Convolutional Neural Networks. In a series of qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate how we accurately predict object thickness and reconstruct general 3D scenes containing multiple objects.","2380-7504","978-1-7281-4803-8","10.1109/ICCV.2019.00160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9010822","","Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Shape;Task analysis;Robots;Surface reconstruction;Pipelines","cameras;convolutional neural nets;image fusion;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence);solid modelling","KinectFusion approach;general indoor scenes;RGB-D camera;robotic manipulation tasks;efficient scene exploration;high spatial resolution;training data requirements;cross-section prediction;enhanced RGB-D fusion;virtual reality;depth cameras;machine learning;X-Section;RGB-D 3D reconstruction approach;deep learning;object-level predictions;volumetric multiview fusion process;object thickness prediction;general 3D scene reconstruction;convolutional neural networks","","7","","46","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to design, manufacturing and sensory-motor integration, psychophysics and haptic guidelines add complexity, over-all intertwined requiring interdisciplinary knowledge. Inspired by the hyper-underactuated robotic architecture of the wearable Hexotrac multi-finger hand robot [1], we develop an open architecture 1-finger exoskeleton ready to be enlarged as multi-fingered. Human-in-the-loop experiments show unconstrained 6D natural ROM of active index-finger, with functionality as haptic finger-robot running in virtual environments developed in Unity3D. Analysis shows that indeed human interaction force is propagated as torques into input channels to command the exoskeleton as a cyberphysical system, in free and constrained motion.

The proposed approach first implements a temporal frame-clustering algorithm based on the curvature of pivot vertex trajectory. Then, a decorrelation method is used to remove the redundancy of data in x, y, and z coordinates. Next, to reduce the amount of mesh sequence data, the vertex motion trajectory data in each cluster is compressed using principal component analysis (PCA). Further, the coefficients of x, y and z coordinates obtained from different principal components are considered as mesh signals, which are processed by a spectral graph wavelet transform(SGWT). Finally, the obtained wavelet coefficients are encoded using CSPECK. By transmitting data on different bit-planes from encoder, a 3D mesh sequence is encoded into a multi-resolution sequence. Experimental results show that the proposed method can realize progressive streaming of mesh sequence.

During the development and evaluation of SIDNIE we realized the importance of determining the visual and interaction fidelity requirements necessary for proper learning. In this paper we report on two fidelity studies conducted with nursing students. The goal of the visual fidelity study was to determine if our virtual characters containing life-like animations would have an effect on learning or if we would get the same effect using a stationary image of our virtual environment. The second study focused on the interaction fidelity of our system and the goal was to determine if the interaction modality had an effect on the learning outcome.

However, as more personal and business applications migrate to the Cloud, the service quality becomes an important differentiator between providers. ISPs, Cloud providers and enterprises migrating their services to the Cloud must therefore understand the network requirements to ensure proper end-user Quality of Experience (QoE) in these services. This paper addresses the problem of QoE in Telepresence and Remote Collaboration (TRC) services provided by Microsoft Lync Online (MLO). MLO is a Cloud-based service providing online meeting capabilities including videoconferencing, audio calls, and desktop sharing, and has become the default system for TRC in enterprise scenarios. We present a complete study of the QoE undergone by 44 MLO users in controlled subjective lab tests. The study is performed on three different interactive scenarios running on top of the real MLO Cloud service, additionally shaping the Lync flows at the access network to influence the participants experience. The scenarios include audioconferencing, video-conferencing, and remote collaboration though desktop sharing. By passively monitoring the end-to-end QoS achieved by the Lync flows, and correlating it with the QoE feedbacks provided by the participants, this study permits to better understand the interplays between network performance and QoE in TRC Cloud services. In addition, we provide a network-level characterization of the traffic generated by MLO, as well as an overview on the infrastructure hosting MLO servers.","","978-1-4799-2730-2","10.1109/CloudNet.2014.6969019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6969019","Microsoft Lync Online;Telepresence;Audioconferencing;Videoconferencing;Remote Desktop Sharing;Cloud QoE;Distributed Data Center;MOS","Quality of service;Servers;Teleconferencing;Cloud computing;Throughput;Collaboration;Standards","cloud computing;control engineering computing;mobile computing;quality of experience;quality of service;teleconferencing;telecontrol;video communication;virtual reality","Microsoft lync online;mobile networks;quality of experience;cloud-based systems;service quality;ISP;cloud provider;network requirements;telepresence and remote collaboration service;TRC service;cloud-based service;online meeting capability;videoconferencing;audio calls;desktop sharing;default system;MLO user;MLO cloud service;access network;audioconferencing;video-conferencing;end-to-end QoS;QoE feedback;network performance;TRC cloud services;network-level characterization","","","","25","IEEE","1 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we investigate the joint optimal placement of virtual service chains consisting of virtual application functions (components) and the steering of traffic through them, over a 5G multi-technology edge network model consisting of both Ethernet and mmWave links. This problem is NP-hard. We provide a comprehensive “microscopic” binary integer program to model the system, along with a heuristic that is one order of magnitude faster than solving the corresponding binary integer program. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the benefits of managing virtual service chains (by distributing them over the edge network) compared to a baseline “middlebox” approach in terms of overall admissible virtual capacity. We observe significant gains when deploying mmWave links that complement the Ethernet physical infrastructure. Moreover, most of the gains are attributed to only 30% of these mmWave links.","","978-1-5386-4633-5","10.1109/NETSOFT.2018.8460097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8460097","","5G mobile communication;Routing;Delays;Computational modeling;Virtualization;Authentication;Solid modeling","5G mobile communication;integer programming;local area networks;millimetre wave communication;mobile computing;next generation networks;telecommunication traffic;virtualisation","bandwidth demand;core network;ultra-low latency communication;virtual service chains;virtual application functions;5G multitechnology edge network model;comprehensive microscopic binary integer program;admissible virtual capacity;virtual function placement;traffic steering;5G multitechnology networks;next-generation mobile networks;virtual reality;augmented reality;edge computing;mmWave links","","11","","24","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such a system, a small number of running jobs with unexpectedly large memory allocation requirements may significantly increase the queuing delay times of the rest of jobs with normal memory requirements, slowing down executions of individual jobs and decreasing the system throughput. We call this phenomenon as the job blocking problem because the big jobs block the execution pace of majority jobs in the cluster. We propose a software method incorporating with dynamic load sharing, which adaptively reserves a small set of workstations through virtual cluster reconfiguration to provide special services to the jobs demanding large memory allocations. This policy implies the principle of shortest-remaining-processing-time policy. As soon as the blocking problem is resolved by the reconfiguration, the system will adaptively switch back to the normal load sharing state. We present three contributions in this study. (1) the conditions to cause the job blocking problem; (2) the adaptive software method in a dynamic load sharing system; and (3) trace-driven simulations.

We explore Mark Weiser's notions of seamlessness and 'seamfulness', and use them in discussing the design and use of wearable and ubicomp systems. The physical nature of the systems we design reveals itself in, for example, uncertainty in sensing, limited coverage of communications infrastructure and the transformations needed to share data between heterogeneous tools and media. When such seams show through, as they inevitably do, users perceive and appropriate them for their own uses. We suggest that new opportunities for system design arise if we take fuller account of this process, and consider making it a deliberate policy to reveal and use seams. We offer examples of seams and some suggestions for seamful design, drawing from the Equator interdisciplinary research collaboration's work on ubiquitous computing and mixed reality systems. More particularly, we focus on our work in Equator's City project, on a system that lets a visitor using a PDA in a museum exhibition or cultural institution co-visit with people using virtual reality and Web versions of the same institution.

To this end, generated force is identified with respect to drone's thrust command, allowing a precise control of force. Force control is combined with tracking of drone and hand, turning the HapticDrone into an ideal end-effector for the encountered-type haptics and making the system ready for more sophisticated physics simulation. Stiffness and weight of a virtual object is our first target of the simulation. Conventional stiffness and gravity simulation is merged into the encountered-type position control scheme, allowing a user to feel the softness and weight of an object.

MPEG recently developed a video-based point cloud compression (V-PCC) standard for dynamic point cloud coding. However, reconstructed point clouds using V-PCC suffer from different artifacts, including losing data during pre-processing before applying existing video coding techniques, e.g., High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Patch generations and self-occluded points in the 3D to the 2D projection are the main reasons for missing data using V-PCC. This paper proposes a new method that introduces overlapping slicing as an alternative to patch generation to decrease the number of patches generated and the amount of data lost. In the proposed method, the entire point cloud has been cross-sectioned into variable-sized slices based on the number of self-occluded points so that data loss can be minimized in the patch generation process and projection. For this, a variable number of layers are considered, partially overlapped to retain the self-occluded points. The proposed method's added advantage is to reduce the bits requirement and to encode geometric data using the slicing base position. The experimental results show that the proposed method is much more flexible than the standard V-PCC method, improves the rate-distortion performance, and decreases the data loss significantly compared to the standard V-PCC method.","","978-1-6654-5642-5","10.1109/DICTA56598.2022.10034563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10034563","dynamic point cloud;3D point cloud;compression;V-PCC","Point cloud compression;Three-dimensional displays;Digital images;Video sequences;Transform coding;Rate-distortion;Encoding;Image reconstruction;Standards;High efficiency video coding","augmented reality;avatars;computer graphics;geographic information systems;history;solid modelling;virtual reality","dynamic 3D objects;dynamic point cloud compression;object-based interaction;real-world objects;realistic digital representations;realistic physical world interactions;realistic visual representation model;self-occluded points;static D objects;users;virtual world","","","","40","IEEE","10 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network slicing is a key enabler to realize this concept, and comes with various SLA requirements in terms of latency, throughput, and reliability. Network slicing is typically performed in an end-to-end (e2e) manner across multiple domains, for example, in mobile networks, a slice can span access, transport and core networks. Thus, if an SLA requirement is specified for e2e services, we need to ensure that the total SLA budget is appropriately proportioned to each participating domain in an adaptive manner. Such an SLA decomposition can be extremely useful for network service operators as they can plan accordingly for actual deployment. In this paper we design and implement an SLA decomposition planner for network slicing using supervised machine learning algorithms. Traditional optimization based approaches cannot deal with the dynamic nature of such services. We design machine learning models for SLA decomposition, based on random forest, gradient boosting and neural network. We then evaluate each class of algorithms in terms of accuracy, sample complexity, and model explainability. Our experiments reveal that, in terms of these three requirements, the gradient boosting and neural network algorithms for SLA decomposition out-perform random forest algorithms, given emulated data sets.","","978-1-7281-5684-2","10.1109/NetSoft48620.2020.9165317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165317","Network slicing;E2E orchestration;SLA;random forest;gradient boosting;neural networks","Machine learning;Network slicing;Data models;Training;Optimization;5G mobile communication;Quality of service","augmented reality;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;random forests;supervised learning","mobile networks;core networks;total SLA budget;network service operators;SLA decomposition planner;network slicing;supervised machine learning algorithms;neural network algorithms;end-to-end slice SLA decomposition;network service industry;industrial automation;augmented reality;virtual reality","","5","","26","IEEE","12 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving framework employing Federated Learning (FL) for online viewport prediction in a live 360° video streaming scenario. In this framework, the user data is only collected and processed on the client-side in the current viewing session and not shared with external parties, e.g., servers, and other clients. We evaluated the framework over a widely-used dataset and measure the computation and transmission time of the proposed streaming system. The experiments show that our framework provides high prediction accuracy and achieves real-time computation requirements of live video streaming. On privacy preservation, our results demonstrate that in a tile-based 360° video streaming system, the user identification rate can be decreased by 18.11 percentage points in 4 x 3 tiles per frame and 9.65 percentage points in 16x9 tiles per frame.

For example, for a real-time performance it is highly desirable to lighten the geometry and optimize the runtime animation of characters wherever possible. An important need in such systems is to assist the CG artists in seamlessly transforming their modeling work from CG packages to the real-time application, without limiting their expressivity. In this paper we describe techniques by which dressed human characters are modeled, loaded into VR scenes, and simulated in real-time. In doing so, we point out challenging issues and solutions that such tasks imply at each phase of modeling and simulation. In particular, we turn our attention to what we consider as key technical components: body and clothes.

In this study, we propose an offline PCG method for generating credible initial Sokoban states, that are also entertaining for players. For this, we propose a hybrid PCG approach, combining an ad-hoc heuristic for generating base Sokoban boards with an evolutionary algorithm for positioning elements on it. We then evaluate the boards created through a user study. Results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid PCG approach is capable of generating content that is indistinguishable from human-made game boards while also being entertaining to play. The implemented PCG approach is an example of the use of evolutionary algorithms in the search for new content.

In this work, we propose an Adaptive DRX (ADRX) scheme and design a control policy to optimally adjust active duration of the DRX cycle in order to satisfy XR requirements and minimize energy consumption. To this end, we formulate the problem of selecting the user active time as a stochastic online optimization problem and present a control policy to optimally solve it. Numerical results confirm that the proposed solution increases the number of satisfied users and reduce power consumption compared to standard DRX mechanism. In particular, in a Dense Urban scenario where standard DRX cannot fulfill the requirements of any XR user, ADRX can serve up to 4-5 users per cell with 10% power saving gain.","2577-2465","978-1-6654-8243-1","10.1109/VTC2022-Spring54318.2022.9860663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860663","Extended Reality;Discontinuous Reception;Lyapunov optimization;5G-Advanced","Heating systems;Vehicular and wireless technologies;Power demand;5G mobile communication;Extended reality;Quality of service;X reality","3G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;channel capacity;cooling;Long Term Evolution;power consumption;stochastic programming;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic;virtual reality","5G advanced;extended reality applications;radio mobile systems;XR devices;power consumption;battery lifetime;dissipated heat;user devices;5G power saving schemes;control policy;active duration;DRX cycle;energy consumption;stochastic online optimization problem;standard DRX mechanism;adaptive discontinuous reception;adaptive DRX scheme;ADRX;Dense Urban scenario","","","","19","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A relatively new approach to information presentation is semantic maps. Semantic maps provide more detail about an environment than typical maps because they are augmented by icons or symbols that provide meaning for places or objects of interest. In this paper we present snapshot technology as a means to take pictures from the real world and store them in a semantic map. To make the snapshots and semantic map available to an operator, we identify and discuss general attributes for useful displays and present a mixed reality 3D interface that meets the requirements.

Virtual and augmented reality has the potential to become one of the most innovative technologies for the next decade. One of the most important aspects of these technologies is related to the spatial location of objects or people in defined environments, for which there are several techniques. One of the most widely used is based on visual marker recognition. The main problems of these approaches are related to the accuracy, the changing environments, the processing time, the operating range/distance and the price. The popularization of these technologies produces a pull effect toward the companies developing the best technology at the lowest price. This paper proposes a marker design and an algorithm to detect the markers under different ambient conditions, with a long range to be executed on embedded systems with low computational requirements. The proposed method reduces the existing problems in the state-of-the-art related to the use of different environments and conditions such as different distances or different illumination.

Due to the lack of simulation frameworks, the path planning algorithms designed to navigate a collision-free path in complex human environments are often tested in real environments. This paper identifies critical requirements for an ideal simulator for this task, evaluates existing simulation frameworks, and, most importantly, identifies the challenges and limitations of the existing simulation techniques. First and foremost, we recognize that the simulators needed for testing mobile robots designed for human environments are unique as they must model realistic pedestrian behavior in addition to modeling of mobile robots. Our study finds that Pedsim_ros [2] and a more recent SocNavBench framework [3] are the only two 3D simulation frameworks that meet most of the critical requirements defined in our paper.

Our application domain is 3D telepresence where users in front of a three-dimensional display need to be captured from all directions. The captured data is used to virtually reconstruct the group of people at a remote location. One key requirement of such applications is that contributions from different color and depth cameras match, as closely as possible, in spatially overlapping or adjacent regions. Our method employs a tracked checker-board to establish a number of correspondences between positions in color and depth camera space and in world space. These correspondences are used to construct a single calibration and registration volume per RGBD sensor which maps raw depth sensor values in a single step into a joint coordinate system and to their associated color values. This approach considerably reduces reconstruction latency by omitting expensive image rectification processes during runtime. Furthermore, our evaluation demonstrates a high measurement accuracy with an average 3D error below 3 mm and an average texture deviation smaller than 0.5 pixels for a space of about 1.5 m × 1.8 m × 1.5 m.","","978-1-4673-6886-5","10.1109/3DUI.2015.7131731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7131731","Telepresence;3D capturing;camera calibration;registration;depth camera;Kinect","Calibration;Sensors;Three-dimensional displays;Image color analysis;Cameras;Accuracy;Interpolation","calibration;cameras;image colour analysis;image reconstruction;image registration;image sensors;three-dimensional displays;virtual reality","volumetric calibration;multiple RGBD-sensor registration;joint coordinate system;color sensor;3D telepresence;three-dimensional display;color camera;depth camera;tracked checker-board;reconstruction latency reduction;image rectification process","","13","","20","IEEE","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Programming WSNs tends to be a complex task for developers, as it requires detailed knowledge of underlying hardware resources as well as their firmware or operating systems. Although many solutions have been proposed up to this date, only a few of those are capable of satisfying challenging demands such as serving multiple user applications and reprogramming the network at run-time in popular highlevel languages such as Java. Sensomax presents a novel combination of several best practices from existing solutions, facilitating fully distributed and decentralized bulk programming and/or updating of sensor nodes; serving multiple simultaneous applications deployed by single or multiple users; allowing dynamic run-time changes in the application requirements; and offering on-the-fly switching between time-driven, data-driven, and event-driven operational paradigms. Sensomax provides a sophisticated set of APIs, a feature-rich desktop application, a web application for cloud-based distributed networks, and a simulator. We demonstrate Sensomax in operation on a real network of 12 Sun Spots deployed as an environment-monitoring system, and 600 virtual Sun Spot nodes running continuously over periods of several weeks, using a novel statistically rigorous adaptive change-point detection algorithm to identify significant “anomalous” changes in the monitored data-streams.","","978-1-4673-6404-1","10.1109/CTS.2013.6567214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567214","Wireless Sensor Networks;WSN;Agents;Java;Sun Spot;Multi-tasking;Middleware","Wireless sensor networks;Middleware;Programming;Sun;Logic gates;Mobile agents;Message systems","cloud computing;high level languages;Java;middleware;software agents;virtual reality;wireless sensor networks","cloud-based distributed networks;environment-monitoring system;virtual sun spot nodes;adaptive change-point detection algorithm;Web application;feature-rich desktop application;API;on-the-fly switching;sensor nodes;decentralized bulk programming;highlevel languages;network reprogramming;multiple user applications;operating systems;firmware;hardware resources;resource-rich raspberry pi boards;resource-constrained sun spot nodes;Java-enabled embedded systems;WSN;wireless sensor networks;decentralized dynamic data-gathering;agent-based middleware;sensomax","","13","","18","IEEE","25 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although many of them have achieved remarkable improvements in accuracy, there remains problem with the generality of the static model when it comes to diverse scenes. In this paper, a novel deep network with dynamic routing architecture is proposed with a dynamically adjustable structure with respect to different inputs, therefore leading to not only improvements on both accuracy and generality but also decrease of the model parameters.

In addition, the rapid growth of new technologies such as 5G, cloud computing, IoT and AR/VR has prompted the demand for even higher data rates, requiring optical modules to scale beyond 400Gb/s while targeting the best possible tradeoff between power efficiency and reach. This necessitates more complex equalization schemes and coding techniques such as probabilistic shaping (PS) [1] and drives ever higher the specifications of analog building blocks. These requirements, as a result, constantly push the envelope of traditional analog-front-end (AFE) bandwidth and the rates of companion data converters such as DACs and ADCs to the technology limits, making it challenging to address a diversity of DSP modulation needs and oversampling rates while maintaining low power consumption.

Straight-forward collision avoidance solutions can provide this safety requirement with conservative margins. These margins heavily reduce the robot's workspace and make interaction with the patient's unguided body parts impossible. However, interaction with the own body is highly beneficial from a therapeutic point of view. We tackle this problem by combining haptic rendering techniques with classical computer vision methods. Our proposed solution consists of a pipeline that builds collision objects from point clouds in real-time and a controller that renders haptic interaction. The raw sensor data is processed to overcome noise and occlusion problems. Our proposed approach is validated on the 6 DoF exoskeleton ANYexo for direct impacts, sliding scenarios, and dynamic collision surfaces. The results show that this method has the potential to successfully prevent collisions and allow haptic interaction for highly dynamic environments.

To solve this problem, we introduce a novel method called MCA to simulate the fracture of heterogeneous materials. The method of movable cellular automata (MCA) is based on the discrete concept and provides advantages both of classical cellular automaton and discrete element methods. First, the object is represented as discrete sphere particles, named movable cellular automata, and then the MCA method is used to simulate the material and physical properties as well as to determine when and where the fracture occurs. To meet the real-time requirement, the MCA simulation is performed on GPU with CUDA in order to accelerate the complex calculation of automata's physical properties. After simulation, the results are directly sent to the vertex buffer object (VBO) for rendering to avoid the costly communication between CPU and GPU. The experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","","978-1-4577-1079-7","10.1109/CAD/Graphics.2011.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062814","fracture;animation;movable cellular automata;heterogeneous;GPU","Automata;Graphics processing unit;Materials;Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Force;Mathematical model","cellular automata;computer animation;virtual reality","MCA based animation;object fracture animation;object materials;movable cellular automata;discrete element methods;discrete sphere particles;GPU;CUDA;vertex buffer object;VBO;heterogeneous materials fracture","","2","","24","IEEE","31 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome the limitations of traditional bandgap and sub-bandgap references, several CMOS-only VR architectures have been recently reported. A two-transistor VR (2TVR) has been introduced in [1]. This circuit operates in the subthreshold region, does not require a startup mechanism, and offers a below-0.5V output voltage while consuming picowatt power at room temperature.

In order to meet the above time-sensitive services, IETF has proposed Deterministic Network (DetNet) architecture, which provides an ideal deterministic delay through clock synchronization, zero congestion loss and other mechanisms. Deadline-aware Transport Protocol (DTP) is design to specify the deadline in application layer, and then meets the requirements in transport layer, which can support the time-sensitive services easily. However, the current packet transmission mechanisms are all rule-based and relatively static strategies, which cannot meet the demand of time-sensitive service in dynamic networks. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm to dynamically adjust the transmission priority by combining the DTP and reinforcement learning to tackle this issue. More specifically, we design the reward function according to the requirements of DTP, and propose the algorithm of congestion control and packet scheduling in the transport layer. We consider not only the priority but also the service deadline. Comprehensive experiments show that our algorithm performs better in the transmission of time-sensitive services compared to traditional packet scheduling strategies.","","978-1-6654-7384-2","10.1109/BigCom57025.2022.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10064431","Time-sensitive service;DTP;congestion control;packet scheduling","Transport protocols;Adaptive systems;Scheduling algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Real-time systems;Delays","cloud computing;Internet of Things;reinforcement learning;scheduling;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication scheduling;transport protocols","adaptive packet scheduling algorithm;AR-VR;clock synchronization;cloud games;deadline-aware transport protocol;deterministic network architecture;DetNet;DTP;IETF;Internet of things;mobile Internet;packet scheduling;packet transmission mechanisms;reinforcement learning;time-sensitive service;time-sensitive services;video conferencing;zero congestion loss","","","","22","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, the current wide spread of mobile devices and wireless technologies brings an enormous potential to e-learning, in terms of ubiquity, pervasiveness, personalization, flexibility, and so on. For this reason, Mobile Learning is attracting significant research efforts covering a fairly variety of learning settings, from schools and universities to workplaces and cities. This research has evidenced that mobile technology can offer new opportunities for learners to learn inside and beyond the traditional instructor-oriented educational paradigm. However, mobile technologies are still in its infancy and many challenges arise. In this paper we analyze, from both learning and technological perspectives, the development of learning applications using mobile devices. To this end, proxy and proxy less architectures are considered as way to extend traditional virtual campuses with mobile clients. The objective is twofold: to access learning materials and to support learning activities. A prototype of a Virtual Campus is developed using MLE-Moodle –the Mobile Learning module of Moodle. The proposed Virtual Campus enables mobile clients to perform online learning activities and is a step towards achieving the “anytime, anywhere” paradigm.","","978-1-4244-8538-3","10.1109/3PGCIC.2010.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5662787","Mobile Learning;Awareness;Mobile technologies;Pervasiveness;Web application;MLE Moodle","Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Computer architecture;Servers;Context;Collaboration;Mobile computing","computer aided instruction;mobile computing;virtual reality","mobile campus;MLE moodle;mobile learning;online learning activities;mobile devices;wireless technologies;e-learning;virtual campuses;mobile clients;learning materials","","8","","45","IEEE","13 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many cases, working on such an application involves a wide range of programming activities such as 3D graphics, networking, user interfaces and audio programming. At the same time, such applications are usually real time and performance critical. The complexity of developing such an application comes from two sources: first, the programming language used in development with its strengths and also the limitations it imposes. The second is the requirements of the virtual environment itself, with its dynamics and size. Some languages are more suitable than others for any given application domain, but in general once a programming language is selected, the main focus is the application itself and not the language used. This paper presents an approach where a virtual environment (CVE) and its implementation language (Unicon) evolved together over the course of the project development, derived from emerging functional and performance requirements. The Unicon language was improved and new features were added over time to meet new demands and address the complexities that arose at the application level. This approach was combined with developing a framework to build virtual worlds with a social integrated development environment and to populate those worlds with non-player characters.","","978-1-4577-1453-5","10.1109/CW.2011.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6079346","language design;cve;3D models;social IDE;object selection;language-application codesign;virtual worlds","Three dimensional displays;Graphics;Arrays;Solid modeling;Computer languages;Libraries;Load modeling","programming languages;solid modelling;virtual reality","collaborative virtual environment;programming language codesign approach;3D virtual environment;3D graphics activity;networking activity;user interface activity;audio programming activity;Unicon language;virtual world;social integrated development environment","","1","","11","IEEE","17 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In view of the unreal characteristics of the vascular model of the training system studied in the past, this paper modeled the vascular model on the Unity platform in order to make the virtual training system more immersive, improve the sense of surgical experience of doctors, and increase the sense of presence of doctors during surgery. This paper mainly aims at using the new model in the virtual training system established in the lab when the blood vessel model is a rigid body model when the collision occurs, and the effect of blood vessel deformation is added in the new model, so as to improve the training experience of the virtual training system.

There may be limitations in transmission range and capacity, power availability, spatial coverage and location, etc. These limitations may be alleviated through abstractions implemented by cooperating objects. Such abstractions span a range of diverse approaches, each suited to specific ambient conditions and applications. This work proposes an ontology that defines an API for the management of a Virtual Node Layer (VNL) in sensor (or in general, M2M) networks. Such an API can manage regions, virtual nodes and virtual topologies. The management service primitives are independent of the user plane service primitives allowing applications development to take place without considering the characteristics of the underlying network topology in advance of actual deployment. Dynamic adaptation to ambient conditions and service requirements are additionally supported by adopting the most efficient virtualization for the environment of deployment.","2157-023X","978-1-4244-3942-3","10.1109/ICUMT.2009.5345589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5345589","Ontology;Virtualization;VNL;M2M;API","Ontologies;Peer to peer computing;Web and internet services;IP networks;Telecommunication network topology;Availability;Telecommunication standards;Network servers;Web server;Spine","ad hoc networks;application program interfaces;mobile computing;network topology;ontologies (artificial intelligence);virtual reality;wireless sensor networks","ontology based abstraction;M2M virtual nodes;M2M topology;machine to machine;wireless network;ad hoc networks;application program interface;virtual node layer;sensor networks;network topology","","1","","14","IEEE","4 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Designers find with 3D user interfaces new ways to promote and interact with data, such as e-commerce websites, scientific data visualization, etc. Because of the wide variety of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications in terms of hardware, data and target users, there is a real interest in solutions for automatic adaption in order to improve the user experience in any context while reducing the development costs. An adaptation is performed in reaction to different criteria defining a system such as the targeted hardware platform, the user's context and the structure and the semantic of the manipulated data. This adaptation can then impact the system in different ways, especially content presentation, interaction techniques modifications and eventually the current distribution of the system across a set of available devices. We present the state of the art about plastic 3D user interfaces. Moreover, we present well known methods in the field of 2D user interfaces that could become relevant for 3D user interfaces.

In a pandemic, people cannot carry out learning activities in museums because of museum closure. An innovative virtual museum is needed for presenting information quickly which is interesting, interactive, and relevant to the user's requirement, especially for museum learning which is identical to old fashion collections and is less attractive, especially for millennials. Some museums in the world have shifted the educational role of physical museums to virtual or digital museums. However, it is more than a recreational purpose while the educational role has not been optimized. The new conceptual model proposed in this study integrates learning outcome indicators and machine learning into the development of virtual museum content to produce attractive virtual museums and be able to analyze and assess user knowledge abilities for improving museum learning purposes. The evaluation carried out on testing the hypothesis related to the impact of the proposed virtual museum model development on the performance of museum learning during the pandemic was conducted using the Partial Least Square Structured Equation Model (PLS-SEM) method. The virtual museum usage affects museum learning performance with a significance level of R2 > 0.5, and the model fit level is good where VIF < 3. These findings become strong baselines for museums organization to consider developing digital media of innovative virtual museums for learning enhancement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As a kind of human-computer interaction (HCI), gesture has the characteristics of strong information expression ability and transmission function, non-contact, and simple and easy to understand, which has been widely used in robot control, virtual reality, intelligent driving, and somatosensory games. The initial interaction method of gesture was through external hardware such as digital gloves, biological myoelectricity, and Kinect depth equipment, and then gradually developed into a method based on computer vision algorithms. The rapid development of deep learning in recent years has greatly improved the performance of image recognition and provided a new direction for gesture recognition. The deep learning method based on convolutional neural network can automatically extract image features, and is less affected by image background factors, which greatly improves the recognition accuracy. With the development of target detection technology, some algorithms have been increasing the depth of the network to obtain higher recognition accuracy, which will lead to excessive computing resource and high hardware requirements. Complex neural networks slow down the model recognition rate and are difficult to apply to resource-constrained mobile and embedded devices. This paper introduces the overall structure of the YOLOv5 network. The model is trained by YOLOv5s network and validated by real gesture. Finally, a gesture recognition software demo is made by PyQT5. The experimental results show that gesture recognition based on YOLOv5 can achieve better recognition accuracy.","","978-1-6654-5160-4","10.1109/ICBAIE56435.2022.9985931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9985931","gesture recognition;You Look Only Once (YOLO);deep leaning;object detection;human-computer interaction","Somatosensory;Human computer interaction;Deep learning;Solid modeling;Image recognition;Gesture recognition;Games","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;data gloves;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;gesture recognition;human computer interaction;image recognition;object detection","artificial intelligence;complex neural networks;computer vision algorithms;computing resource;convolutional neural network;deep learning;digital gloves;embedded device;gesture recognition software demo;human-computer interaction;image background factors;image feature extraction;image recognition;information expression ability;initial interaction method;intelligent driving;Kinect depth equipment;model recognition rate;PyQT5;resource-constrained mobile device;smart digital home;target detection;transmission function;YOLOv5 network","","","","8","IEEE","23 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are multiple tiers of computing (IoT devices, near edge, far edge, cloud, etc.) that are connected with different types of networking technologies (LAN, LTE, 5G, MAN, WAN, etc.). Deployment and management of applications in such an environment is quite challenging. In this paper, we propose ROMA, which performs resource orchestration for microservices-based 5G applications in a dynamic, heterogeneous, multi-tiered compute and network fabric. We assume that only application-level requirements are known, and the detailed requirements of the individual microservices in the application are not specified. As part of our solution, ROMA identifies and leverages the coupling relationship between compute and network usage for various microservices and solves an optimization problem in order to appropriately identify how each microservice should be deployed in the complex, multi-tiered compute and network fabric, so that the end-to-end application requirements are optimally met. We implemented two real-world 5G applications in video surveillance and intelligent transportation system (ITS) domains. Through extensive experiments, we show that ROMA is able to save up to 90%, 55% and 44% compute and up to 80%, 95% and 75% network bandwidth for the surveillance (watchlist) and transportation application (person and car detection), respectively. This improvement is achieved while honoring the application performance requirements, and it is over an alternative scheme that employs a static and overprovisioned resource allocation strategy by ignoring the resource coupling relationships.","2374-9709","978-1-6654-0601-7","10.1109/NOMS54207.2022.9789821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9789821","resource orchestration;IoT;5G;edge computing;microservices;system modelling and optimization","Couplings;5G mobile communication;Microservice architectures;Dynamic scheduling;Video surveillance;Fabrics;Internet of Things","cloud computing;Internet of Things;resource allocation;video surveillance","ROMA;resource orchestration;microservices-based 5G applications;edge computing;cloud computing technologies;networking technologies;network fabric;application-level requirements;individual microservices;network usage;microservice;end-to-end application requirements;real-world 5G applications;95%;75% network bandwidth;transportation application;application performance requirements;resource coupling relationships","","1","","19","IEEE","9 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fundamentally, CNS fosters the deployment of a multitude of modern applications, e.g., virtual and augmented reality, 4K video streaming, and autonomous vehicles, which require ultra-low latency, high bandwidth consumption, or both. Slicing promotes the realization of such services through the allocation of computing and network resource bundles, which, as CNS mandates, are isolated from the rest of the network. Typically, such resources are arranged into wide geographical areas (e.g., into multiple countries or even continents), which implies that it is possible to allocate from multiple infrastructure providers. This exacerbates the already challenging problem of maximizing resource allocation efficiency, a feature commonly addressed by CNS architectures.In this respect, we study the optimized embedding of slices across multiple domains. Therefore, we account for slices as a collection of computing and network parts. Given specific resource requirements from slice tenants and potentially multiple offers per slice part, we model the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). We further design two heuristic algorithms in order to mitigate the complex intricacies that would be perceptible in large problem instances. Our evaluation results, based on a simulation environment aligned with the NECOS slicing architecture, indicate that the MILP approach yields better efficiency compared to both heuristics, with respect to client expenditure with a fair amount of performance parameters in an adequate execution time. Our main contribution lies in the optimization methods based on the split and combine approach, integrated into the NECOS CNS architecture.","2693-9789","978-1-6654-0522-5","10.1109/NetSoft51509.2021.9492536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9492536","Cloud computing;network softwarization;slicing;linear programming;optimization","Cloud computing;Waste materials;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Optimization methods;Computer architecture;Workstations","cloud computing;integer programming;linear programming;optimisation;resource allocation;video streaming;virtualisation","5G mobile network;virtual reality;augmented reality;4K video streaming;CNS mandates;multiple countries;multiple infrastructure providers;resource allocation efficiency;CNS architectures;given specific resource requirements;slice tenants;potentially multiple offers;slice part;NECOS slicing architecture;NECOS CNS architecture;tenant-oriented resource optimization;cloud Network Slicing;Cloud Network Slicing;temperature 4.0 K","","","","11","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most widely applied Real Time Control (RTC) on these systems is Model Predictive Control (MPC), which typically incorporates transport time delays and the effect of disturbances explicitly in the objectives and constraints. One of the greatest challenges in the control of UDNs is to formulate multiple control criteria regarding operational requirements of the network. Furthermore, MPC faces the challenge of handling uncertainty caused by disturbances, e.g. weather predictions. One way to incorporate the uncertainty in the decision making is to consider multiple scenarios, i.e. to generate different ensembles based on rain forecasts. To this end, we propose a Multi-scenario MPC (MS-MPC) approach, that deals with uncertainty in the expected inflow. First, a generic multiobjective MPC is established which deals with the time delays explicitly in the optimization. Then, this framework is extended to our formulation of the multiple scenario problem. The algorithm is verified through a case study by interfacing a high-fidelity simulator model of a sewer network as virtual reality.","","978-1-7281-7140-1","10.1109/CCTA41146.2020.9206362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206362","","Optimization;Mathematical model;Solid modeling;Rain;Delays;Computational modeling;Uncertainty","decision making;optimisation;predictive control;rain;sanitary engineering","multiscenario model predictive control;combined sewer overflows;urban drainage networks;UDN;vital infrastructures;natural water cycle;real time control;transport time delays;multiple control criteria;weather predictions;MS-MPC;generic multiobjective MPC;multiple scenario problem;sewer network;RTC;high-fidelity simulator model;multiscenario MPC approach;optimization;virtual reality","","2","","21","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve near-realistic quality, such content usually contains an extremely high number of points (over 0.5 million points per 3D object per frame) and associated attributes (such as color). For this reason, disposing of efficient, dedicated 3D Point Cloud Compression (3DPCC) methods becomes mandatory. This requirement is even stronger in the case of dynamic content, where the coordinates and attributes of the 3D points are evolving over time. In this paper, we propose a novel skeleton-based 3DPCC approach, dedicated to the specific case of dynamic point clouds representing humanoid avatars. The method relies on a multi-view 2D human pose estimation of 3D dynamic point clouds. By using the DensePose neural network, we first extract the body parts from projected 2D images. The obtained 2D segmentation information is back-projected and aggregated into the 3D space. This procedure makes it possible to partition the 3D point cloud into a set of 3D body parts. For each part, a 3D affine transform is estimated between every two consecutive frames and used for 3D motion compensation. The proposed approach has been integrated into the Video-based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC) test model of MPEG. Experimental results show that the proposed method, in the particular case of body motion with small amplitudes, outperforms the V-PCC test mode in the lossy inter-coding condition by up to 83% in terms of bitrate reduction in low bit rate conditions. Meanwhile, the proposed framework holds the potential of supporting various features such as regions of interests and level of details.","2473-3628","978-1-7281-9320-5","10.1109/MMSP48831.2020.9287165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9287165","skeleton;motion estimation;affine transformation;point cloud;compression","Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays;Bit rate;Pose estimation;Transform coding;Transforms;Signal processing","affine transforms;augmented reality;avatars;computer graphics;data compression;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image segmentation;motion compensation;motion estimation;neural nets;pose estimation;stereo image processing;video coding","skeleton-based motion estimation;point cloud acquisition technologies;high-quality human-shape point clouds;3D Graphics;dynamic point clouds;multiview 2D human;3D motion compensation;skeleton-based 3DPCC approach;3D point cloud compression methods;video-based point cloud compression test model;V-PCC test model;3D affine transform;DensePose neural network;2D segmentation information;humanoid avatars;VR-AR applications;3D body parts;MPEG","","2","","19","EU","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, simpler feature selection methods based on detector (corner) score, lack in identifying features with required invariance and trackability. We present a notion of feature descriptor score as a measure of invariance under distortions.

By employing a regulation technique, the impacts of drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), gate-inducted drain leakage (GIDL), and gate-drain capacitance feedthrough are largely mitigated. Therefore, high performance in line regulation and PSRR are obtained.

The ITB formation can lead to the improvement of energy and particle confinement. Some advanced tokamak scenarios rely on the ITB formation in the plasma core. In particular, the high beta poloidal scenario that has been recently studied on the DIII-D and EAST tokamaks depends on the ITB formation at large radii 1. It is generally believed that ITBs are triggered by a large ExB flow shear and by a small or reversed magnetic shear. However, the analysis of DIII-D experimental data shows that the ExB flow shear plays a small role in the ITB formation in high $\mathrm {b}_{p}$ discharges. Using the integrated modeling approach, we demonstrate that the ITBs in these discharges require a combination of large Shafranov shift and reversed magnetic shear. The ExB flow shear indeed does not play a role in the ITB triggering. In addition, it is demonstrated that the ITB formation depends on the q profiles. An increased plasma current can result in a disappearance of ITB. The dependences of ITB on the Shafranov shift, magnetic shear, and q-profiles can be explained from the analysis of the anomalous transport in high beta poloidal discharges. Theory-based Weiland transport model 2 that predict the anomalous transport driven by ion-temperature gradient driven modes, trapped electron modes and some other MHD modes shows a significant quenching effect from the Shafranov shift. The q-profiles are also found important for the formation of transport barriers in the high beta poloidal DIII-D discharges. The gyro-kinetic GTC simulation confirms the anomalous transport trends observed with the theory-based Weiland model. The observed requirements for the ITB formation can be used in the integrated predictive modeling to optimize the high beta poloidal discharge scenarios in DIIID, EAST and other tokamaks.","2576-7208","978-1-5090-5243-1","10.1109/PLASMA.2017.8496215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8496215","","Discharges (electric);Tokamaks;Magnetic confinement;Predictive models;Magnetic cores;Magnetic analysis","discharges (electric);plasma instability;plasma kinetic theory;plasma magnetohydrodynamics;plasma simulation;plasma temperature;plasma toroidal confinement;plasma transport processes;plasma turbulence;Tokamak devices","tokamak discharges;energy confinement;particle confinement;plasma core;DIII-D tokamak;EAST tokamak;reversed magnetic shear;magnetic shear;ion-temperature gradient driven modes;trapped electron modes;MHD modes;quenching effect;high beta poloidal DIII-D discharges;gyro-kinetic GTC simulation;theory-based Weiland model;high beta poloidal discharge scenarios;theory-based Weiland transport model;high beta poloidal discharges;Shafranov shift;ExB flow shear;ITB formation;anomalous transport;internal transport barriers","","","","2","IEEE","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But unfortunately, with the increment of external ramp value, although the jittering in the system gets better, transient performance becomes worse. For this reasons, from transient point of view, it is very challenging to use large external ramp in the system to improve the noise performance.

We propose a general client-server SLAM optimization framework that achieves accurate real-time state estimation on the device with low requirements of on-board resources. The resource-limited device (the client) only works on a small part of the map, and the rest of the map is processed by the server. By sending the summarized information of the rest of map to the client, the on-device state estimation is more accurate. Further improvement of accuracy is achieved in the presence of on-device early loop closures, which enables reloading useful variables from the server to the client. Experimental results from both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed optimization framework achieves accurate estimation in real-time with limited computation and memory budget of the device.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-9077-8","10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9561638","","Performance evaluation;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Uncertainty;Systematics;Refining;Real-time systems;Servers","augmented reality;client-server systems;mobile robots;optimisation;SLAM (robots)","SLAM algorithms;general client-server SLAM optimization framework;real-time state estimation;low requirements;on-board resources;on-device state estimation;on-device early loop closures;memory budget;distributed client-server optimization;On-Device Resources;crucial functionality;exploration robots;reality devices;computational memory cost","","1","","26","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is well known in the industry that PI will be used as the buffer layer, and low-stress assembly materials include substrate materials will be used to improve the yield and reliability of subsequent package and application due to high stress. For traditional WB products, considering that the chip size is smaller and most of them are wire bond products without soft bump, they are less sensitive to stress, also due the PI cost is relative high, so few researches will focus on the stress improvement of WB products. However, our research shows that some stress-sensitive WB products may cause high yield loss of reference Voltage(Vr) shift due to high stress. The Vr yield loss exceeds 10% or even 20%.

It progresses slowly, with the onset of a barely noticeable tremor in only one hand every now and again. Nevertheless, while tremors are perhaps the most well-known symptom of PD, the ailment is also associated with stiffness and slowness of movement. Three well-established machine learning-based algorithms are used in this study to solve the challenge of enhanced categorization of data accessible at an Internet of Things node. After reviewing current literature, it has been discovered that just a few papers have been published on the categorization and forecasting of IoT-based data using ML approaches. A growing amount of attention has been paid in recent times to the categorization and forecasting of health information that is done online. In light of this aim, the current study investigates the intelligent categorization of PD using data from the Internet of Things (IoT), which is accomplished through the use of ML algorithms. The ML based classifiers employed in this article are the Decision Tree, the Random Forest, and the Naive Bayes. These classifiers were chosen based on their stable and better classification results for other common datasets, which is demonstrated in previous research. The Internet of Things-based node gets the data and provides a categorization answer more quickly, so assisting in choice. The simulation-based studies are carried out with the help of the two representative data sets that have been provided. The findings of the simulations are also used to investigate the relationship between the amount of features and classification accuracy. The results reveal that the Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes are the top three classification algorithms in terms of classification accuracy. Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are the models that rank highest in terms of execution time, while the others are ranked lower.

To overcome limitations of the conventional chip-wide DVFS and achieve the maximum possible energy saving, per-core DVFS is being enabled in the recent CMP offerings. While power consumed by the CMP is reduced by per-core DVFS, power dissipated by many voltage regulators (VRs) needed to support per-core DVFS becomes critical. This paper focuses on the dynamic control of the VRs in a CMP platform. Starting with a proposed platform with a configurable VR-to-core power distribution network, two optimization methods are presented to maximize the system-wide energy savings: (i) reactive VR consolidation to reconfigure the network for maximizing the power conversion efficiency of the VRs performed under the pre-determined DVFS levels for the cores, and (ii) proactive VR consolidation to determine new DVFS levels for maximizing the total energy savings without any performance degradation. Results from detailed experiments demonstrate up to 35% VR energy loss reduction and 14% total energy saving.","1558-1101","978-3-9815370-2-4","10.7873/DATE.2014.378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800579","Low-power design;DC-DC converter;Power delivery network;Multicore;Consolidation","Multicore processing;Regulators;Voltage control;Energy loss;Energy consumption;Switches","integrated circuit interconnections;low-power electronics;microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems;voltage control","VRCon;dynamic reconfiguration;voltage regulator;multicore platform;chip multicore processor;dynamic voltage scaling;frequency scaling;dynamic control;power distribution network;system wide energy savings;power conversion efficiency","","","1","15","","21 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These applications require efficient synchronization among the end points with varying level of loss and delay tolerance. Also application specific requirements like throughput, end-to-end latency and mobility of end points impose even more stringency. IP based solutions often fail to meet these requirements due to lack of efficient multicast. In this paper we study this problem in the context of multi-party video conferencing system, and propose an information-centric solution based on content-centric networking (CCN). CCN, with its innate support for multicast delivery and service centricity, is used to deliver content and control state in a secure and reliable manner. We address the challenge of synchronizing participant states for a real-time experience through a media agnostic notification framework aided by service functions in the CCN network.

Of special interest are networks with high penetration of distributed energy resources, PVs in particular, which exhibit overvoltage problems. To that end, we have adopted a dynamic VR model from the literature and applied the proposed coordinated control method on a modified IEEE 123 test system with very high penetration of PVs. Over Voltage Severity Index (OVSI) and Cumulative Voltage Variation Index (CVVI) have been defined and used in the algorithm to control the regulation steps of VRs.

Big data analysis needs new methods and approaches to handle their complexities. Numerous methods have been developed in the recent years to process this large amount of data. The data can be stored in cloud anytime and can also be retrieved from cloud anytime based on the requirements. As an alternative for data analysis and computing various attempts have been made using new tools. Augmented reality (AR) is an extended feature of virtual reality and it is helpful in visualizing huge amount of data obtained from heterogeneous sectors in a simpler manner. There are a few digitized tools available these days with the help of which process of visualization can be made faster. The scheme of convergence of both the tools (i.e., big data and AR) results in productive applications that are better than a few of existing technologies.

This approach - though it utilizes a simple graph at its core - is highly modular and versatile in representing a broad range of kinematic relations and allows for various applications in the field of simulation and VR. Currently, such diverse areas as forest harvesting processes, advanced production environments, and mechanisms on the International Space Station are covered by our simulation system and its database. As examples of the versatility of this approach, we describe the adaption of the scene graph for the description of kinematic trees. We also present methods for describing targets and paths in Cartesian and in joint coordinates in the simulated world which - in co-operation with the kinematics - offer a powerful tool for controlling complex kinematic mechanisms.

As state-of-the-art overlays do not anticipate this mobility, the needed data is not delivered on time, which leads to transient failures at the application level. To solve this problem, we propose Blue Banana, a mechanism that models and predicts avatar movement, allowing the overlay to adapt itself by anticipation to the MMOG needs.

The motors in the family have the same tooth pitch but are distinguished by tooth width. Magnetic coupling of flux paths among the phases and a corresponding increase in independent variables results in higher modeling complexity and higher requirements on the amount of data needed for characterization as compared to rotary variable reluctance (VR) motors and uncoupled linear variable reluctance (LVR) motors. The study first focuses on building a motor model based on a database of stored 2D magnetostatic finite element analysis (FEA) data and 4-D cubic spline interpolation of the data. The model relates input variables (displacement and phase currents) to corresponding outputs (force, coenergy and phase flux linkages) using the stored data, which accounts for saturation and harmonics. The stored data serves an additional purpose by facilitating comparisons of the motors under study using three force production attributes: the root mean square (RMS) averaged force (averaged over one tooth pitch); the RMS force density and the ratio of RMS force density to copper loss. The comparison shows which distinct tooth geometry is more favorable for each attribute. The second focus of the study is the validation of the model's accuracy in predicting motor force by comparing FEA to the model's force results from three current profiles different from those used and stored for characterization. The two models are shown to give comparable results; this is critical because the model is intended for optimal commutation design and motor operation under feedback control.","1558-058X","978-1-5386-6133-8","10.1109/SECON.2018.8479282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479282","computational efficiency;coupled flux path configuration;cubic spline interpolation;direct linear motion;finite element analysis;harmonics;linear variable reluctance motor;magnetic saturation;nonlinear model","Reluctance motors;Force;Induction motors;Permanent magnet motors;Geometry;Data models","finite element analysis;interpolation;linear synchronous motors;machine theory;magnetic flux;magnetostatics;reluctance motors;splines (mathematics)","operating characteristics;coupled flux paths;coupled linear variable reluctance motors;associated data generation;tooth pitch;tooth width;magnetic coupling;rotary variable reluctance motors;uncoupled linear variable reluctance motors;motor model;stored 2D magnetostatic finite element analysis data;input variables;phase currents;coenergy;phase flux linkages;force production;RMS force density;optimal commutation design;motor operation;independent variables;4D cubic spline interpolation;tooth geometry effect;data management;LVR motors;FEA data;root mean square averaged force;RMS averaged force;copper loss;motor force prediction;current profiles;feedback control","","","","19","USGov","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a need to monitor the running virtual routers in order to allow an adaptive change in the resource allocation. In this paper, we focus on the router data plane virtualization and we explore this issue by presenting a new dynamic allocation approach through queuing theory. We consider the problem where multiple instances of virtual routers (VRs) that have some quality of service (QoS) requirements are sharing different physical resources. We propose a novel router architecture that offers a strong isolation between concurrent VRs and provides a dynamic allocation scheme in order to guarantee the provided QoS to each of them. Our approach aims at providing a higher isolation for the concurrent virtual routers sharing the same infrastructure. We propose a dynamic Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) scheduler for each physical resource and an algorithm for adjusting the weight of each VR in order to reduce the delay of the packet processing and avoid the bottlenecks. We also propose an admission control mechanism that estimates the current load of the physical node and decides either to accept or reject a creation request of a new VR.

In this paper, we design a coded caching with device computing scheme for content computation, e.g., VR rendering, to minimize the average transmission bandwidth. Because both coded data and stored data can be the data before or after computing, the proposed scheme has numerous edge computing and caching paths corresponding to different bandwidth requirement. We thus formulate a joint coded caching and computing optimization problem to decide whether the mobile devices cache the input data or the output data, which tasks to be coded cached and which tasks to compute locally. The optimization problem is shown to be 0-1 nonconvex nonsmooth programming which can be decomposed into the computation programming and the coded caching programming. Computation programming can be solved by utilizing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and then a low complexity algorithm is proposed to obtain the acceptable solution for the coded cache programming.

Some previous methods are inaccurate, have calibration error that is several times the beam divergence, and often require special calibration objects, thereby limiting their ubiquitous use for calibration. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel and high-accuracy method for the extrinsic calibration between a camera and a 3D LiDAR. Our approach relies on the infrared images from a camera with an infrared filter, and the 2D-3D corresponding points in a scene with the corners of a wall can be extracted to calculate the six extrinsic parameters. Experiments using the Velodyne VLP-16 sensor show that the method can achieve an extrinsic accuracy at the level of the beam divergence, which is fully analyzed and validated from two different aspects. Therefore, the calibration method in this paper is highly accurate, effective and does not require special complicated calibration objects; thus, it meets the requirements of practical applications.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-7395-5","10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196512","","Conferences;Automation","calibration;cameras;image filtering;infrared imaging;optical radar","3D LiDAR;infrared images;infrared filter;calibration method;simultaneous location and mapping;Velodyne VLP-16 sensor","","8","","31","IEEE","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It borrows the principle of spotlight SAR that azimuth resolution is derived from corresponding synthetic aperture length and observation angle, namely every azimuth sampling point develops different beam pattern to illuminate certain region due to the synthetic aperture distributions in this system. Optimization of PRF has been conducted to obtain a relative larger swath width and a lessened sample data storages by making resolution of some unimportant and unconcerned details decline under the premise of no azimuth ambiguities. Driven by its specific properties, coding metasurface antenna is utilized to generate desired diverse pattern in real time, making VR SAR possible in practice. There are two potential advantages of the proposed imaging mode: 1) offers the higher resolution and larger image sizes than would otherwise be possible in stripmap and spotlight SAR modes and 2) reduces the pressure of data storages and brings a high imaging efficiency. The mathematical model of VR SAR system is bulit up and the feasibility is demonstrated through a series of simulations, as well as metrits.

The tightest symbol error rate (SER) constraint method, which uses tightest SER constraints to guarantee the BER constraints for every modulation orders, is simple but gives a low bound for optimum capacity, and the iterative method gives local optimum capacity with somewhat higher complexity than the former one. Numerical results show that both proposed schemes can enhance the performance of existing vr-STBCs by achieving greater throughput as well as satisfying BER requirements. Moreover, we can see that the capacity loss caused by the tightest SER constraint is not serious comparing to the iterative one, and the iterative method doesn't increase the calculational complexity seriously. We can see that the proposed AMP schemes show more throughput gain as diversity order is decreasing, comparing to the conventional ones, since the proposed adaptive schemes can bring more gain as the channel fluctuation becomes greater.","1090-3038","978-1-4244-1721-6","10.1109/VETECF.2008.127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4656959","","Bit error rate;Modulation;Throughput;Iterative methods;Receivers;Transmitters;Gain","adaptive modulation;block codes;error statistics;fluctuations;iterative methods;multimedia communication;space-time codes;variable rate codes","joint adaptive modulation;power allocation;variable-rate codes;space-time codes;block codes;BER constraints;unequal error protection;multimedia communications;bit error rate;symbol error rate;optimum capacity;iterative method;channel fluctuation","","1","","7","IEEE","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One issue of this ripple based CMCOT control is that, in the heavy load step up transient, inductor current increment becomes limited by on time (Ton) and minimum off time (Toff_min) ratio in each cycle, which can create large undershoot at the output. On the other hand, in the load step down case, if load change occurs at the beginning of the fixed Ton, a large overshoot can occur as well. For the multiphase operation case, its limited pulse overlapping capability is an issue at heavy load step up transient. States of art controllers add various nonlinear controls to the system to solve these issues. In this paper, a new charge based current mode control is proposed to improve the transient performance in CMCOT by naturally increasing or decreasing the on time in load step up or step down transient and by naturally overlapping these extended pulses in multiphase operation without adding any nonlinear control. The proposed concept is also extended to variable on-time variable off-time control to improve it transient performance. Simulation and test results of proposed control with CMCOT in standard VR platform are also presented in this paper.","","978-1-4673-9550-2","10.1109/APEC.2016.7468333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7468333","constant on time control;transient response;multiphase;pulse overlapping;on time extension","Transient analysis;Inductors;Transient response;Control systems;Load modeling;Capacitors;Logic gates","controllers;electric current control;inductors;nonlinear control systems;transient response","current mode constant on time control;ultrafast load transient response;inductor current ripple;voltage regulators;compensation network;ripple based CMCOT control;inductor current;minimum off time;multiphase operation;load step up transient;controllers;nonlinear controls;variable on-time variable off-time control","","5","","23","IEEE","12 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem and to ensure the QoE (quality of experience) of end-users, this paper presents CUBIST, a method and system for high-quality 360-degree video streaming in networks with cache nodes at the edge. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first tile-based edge caching solution that incorporates proactive tile prefetching and hierarchical cache organization into reactive caching to maximize the caching benefit while reducing the cost of 360-degree video streaming. Experimental results show that CUBIST can achieve a cache hit ratio of 87 % and improve the effective video bitrate by 12.9 % with most rate transitions being small when compared with the latest FoV-aware edge caching scheme.","","978-1-6654-1681-8","10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9590350","360-degree video;edge caching;FoV-adaptive prefetching;QoE","Costs;Web services;Prefetching;Bit rate;Bandwidth;Transcoding;Streaming media","quality of experience;video streaming","quality of experience;CUBIST;cache nodes;tile-based edge caching solution;proactive tile prefetching;high-quality 360-degree video streaming services;FoV-adaptive prefetching;immersive viewing experience;hierarchical reactive cache organization;FoV-aware edge caching scheme;VR-AR application;QoE","","","","50","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, due to the extra communication, even edge computing is challenged by the growing demands for real-time interactive tasks (e.g., VR and AR), which are generally performed by deep CNNs with heavy computation. In this paper, we design a novel system called HRCache to reduce the end-to-end latency by effectively recompressing video data and reusing cached inference results on the edge. As similar image regions have been indicated in the offloading video coding, the edge can approximately infer these regions with results stored on the edge to save the time for calculating these regions. Moreover, since the data in these regions do not require calculation, the transmitted data can be further simplified to reduce transmission latency. Furthermore, HRCache can quickly and continuously adjust the coding parameters to adapt the accuracy loss and overall latency with application requirements. Compared with the original offloading schemes, HRCache significantly reduces the average latency, about 13.60% to 18.83%, at little accuracy loss of 1.25% in Top-1 accuracy for classification and 0.135 in IoU for object detection.","2374-9628","978-1-6654-8018-5","10.1109/IPCCC55026.2022.9894326","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Jilin Scientific and Technological Development Program; Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9894326","edge computing;mobile deep vision;cache reuse;recompression;edge-end collaboration","Video coding;Performance evaluation;Visualization;Image edge detection;Collaboration;Object detection;Streaming media","cache storage;computer vision;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);edge computing;inference mechanisms;mobile computing;object detection;video coding","accuracy loss;approximated reuse;coding parameters;computation capability;computationally intensive visual tasks;deep CNNs;edge computing;edge-end collaboration;extra communication;H.264 coding;heavy computation;HRCache;inference results;mobile deep vision;mobile devices;offloading video coding;original offloading schemes;powerful computing resources;real-time interactive tasks;reusing;similar image regions;transmitted data;video data;video data recompression","","","","26","IEEE","12 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IEEE Time-sensitive networking (TSN) standards provide high-reliability & determinism across wired (Ethernet) networks. Time-critical hard/soft real-time applications typically run over these wired TSN links. However, TSN over-wired links lack the mobility and potential to meet all the needs of Industry 4.0. New generation wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi and 5G that are now introducing TSN supporting capabilities can fulfill this need. The 5G Release 16 from the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) supports Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), which brings the possibility of combining 5G with TSN to meet the stringent requirements of industry 4.0. 5G that comes with the support of both private and public networks is coupled with TSN to support the use cases with deterministic performance and required latency levels. The 5G-TSN networks must provide a low end-to-end (E2E) latency to support time-sensitive applications. The traffic steering delay within the User Equipment (UE) in edge compute devices is a critical component in addition to network latencies. This paper discusses the traffic steering aspects of UE and proposes a new use case of eXpress Data Path (XDP) programming over the 5G modem of UE to efficiently steer the traffic in 5G-TSN networks. Experiment results show that the proposed solution provides 100 times lower latency in traffic steering latency compared to a conventional Layer 2 (L2) software bridge.","","978-1-6654-1086-1","10.1109/WFCS53837.2022.9779167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9779167","TSN;5G;5G-TSN;Industry 4.0;eXpress Data Path;eBPF","Wireless communication;5G mobile communication;Service robots;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Software;Fourth Industrial Revolution;3GPP","5G mobile communication;IEEE standards;real-time systems;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","edge compute devices;industrial automation;IEEE Time-sensitive networking;wired networks;wired TSN links;TSN supporting capabilities;5G Release 16;3rd Generation Partnership Project;Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications;private networks;public networks;required latency levels;5G-TSN networks;support time-sensitive applications;traffic steering delay;network latencies;traffic steering aspects;eXpress Data Path programming;5G modem;end-to-end latency","","1","","16","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper studies the problem of optimizing the power consumption of the mobile stations (MSs) in the cell of a base station (BS) where each MS has several uplink and downlink connections of real-time services. In order to adapt to heterogeneous delay and jitter requirements of different real-time services, the concept of aperiodic scheduling in is adopted in this paper. In this approach, the MSs wake up by following the pre-allocated transmission schedule given by the BS. The goal of the studied problem is to find an optimal transmission schedule such that the total power consumption can be minimized while the delay and jitter constraints of all connections are still satisfied. In this paper, the integer programming model of the problem is formulated and a lower bound of total power consumption is also derived. Because of its NP-hardness, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain near-optimal solutions. By the numerical results, it is shown that the achieved power consumption of the proposed algorithm is only about 2% higher than the lower bound in the cases where each MS has two UGS and two RT VR connections.","","978-1-61284-829-7","10.1109/WAINA.2011.80","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763608","WiMAX;Power Saving;QoS;multimedia streaming service","OFDM;Downlink;Power demand;Quality of service;Schedules;IEEE 802.16 Standards;Delay","integer programming;multimedia communication;power consumption;quality of service;WiMax","power consumption;mobile stations;mobile WiMAX network;multimedia streaming;quality of service;QoS;base station;integer programming model","","1","","10","IEEE","5 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The quad format dominated for over 20 years, until it was finally replaced by the helical format. Now, thousands of Quad tapes are sitting on archive shelves, but only a few quad machines exist in a few special facilities. — Since the helical videotape recorder was first introduced in 1962, there have been an average of about two new videotape formats per year. About half of these obtained some degree of popularity and half ended up on the format floor. This abundance of old tape formats is a major problem for anyone with old videotapes with no machines to play them on. As a member of the engineering team that developed the Ampex VR-660 in 1962 and several other Ampex videotape recorders since then, I have closely followed the development of videotape formats. A chart of about 40 of the more popular videotape formats is presented. — The problem of equipment obsolescence is a major problem and is magnified at a large Archive, like the Library of Congress. Recently, the Library of Congress held hearings at three cities in the U.S., at which they heard from national archives, regional archives, production studios, broadcasters, educators, and technology experts on the topic of “The current status of American Television and Video preservation”. At these hearings, several people voiced their concern about the problem of dealing with the continual birth and death cycle of videotape formats. — SMPTE Study Group V16.09 “User Requirements for Automated Storage and Retrieval” was formed in December, and members have expressed their concern about the format problem and that something should be done about it. Possibly, this SMPTE Group could work with archivists to specify a universal archival format.","","978-1-61482-925-6","10.5594/M00116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7263255","","","","","","1","","","","19 Oct 2015","","","SMPTE","SMPTE Conferences"

The high amount of data collected with LiDAR, RGB-D cameras or generated through SfM approaches makes the direct use of the recorded data for realistic rendering and simulation problematic. Therefore, these point clouds have to be transformed into representations that fulfill the computational requirements for VR and AR setups. In this tutorial participants will be introduced to state-of-the-art methods in point cloud processing and surface reconstruction with open source software to learn the benefits for AR and VR applications by interleaved presentations, software demonstrations and software trials. The focus lies on 3D point cloud data structures (range images, octrees, k-d trees) and algorithms, and their implementation in C/C++. Surface reconstruction using Marching Cubes and other meshing methods will play another central role. Reference material for subtopics like 3D point cloud registration and SLAM, calibration, filtering, segmentation, meshing, and large scale surface reconstruction will be provided. Participants are invited to bring their Linux, MacOS or Windows laptops to gain hands-on experience on practical problems occuring when working with large scale 3D point clouds in VR and AR applications.","","978-1-5386-7592-2","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct.2018.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8699241","","","augmented reality;computer graphics;octrees;public domain software;rendering (computer graphics);surface reconstruction","3D scanning technology;realistic rendering;open source software;3D point cloud data structures;3D point cloud registration;large scale 3D point cloud processing;large scale surface reconstruction;Marching Cubes;octrees;k-d trees;meshing methods;augmented reality","","1","","","IEEE","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Foreword","C. Lee",NA,"2021 ITU Kaleidoscope: Connecting Physical and Virtual Worlds (ITU K)","6 Jan 2022","2021","","","1","2","The ITU Kaleidoscope academic conference has gained a reputation for providing an in-depth discussion on matters relevant to the ITU membership. This year, Kaleidoscope 2021: Connecting physical and virtual worlds provides a forward-looking perspective on the future developments of persistent virtual realities and customized computer-generated environments. Kaleidoscope is ITU's flagship academic event. Now in its thirteenth edition, the conference supports productive dialogue between academics and standardization experts. For the second year in a row, Kaleidoscope is held fully online, welcoming participants from around the world from 6 to 10 December 2021. The research included in the conference highlights how things, places and people are being mirrored in a parallel virtual world, creating immersive new communications experiences and how this translates to fundamental shifts in business and education as well as healthcare, automotive, logistics and entertainment. Focusing on the technical developments that are contributing to a new and more immersive future, the research selected for presentation also sheds light on the standards that are needed to aid in this digital transformation and provide a safe, human-centred future. The various sessions focus on future wireless communication systems and machine learning for next generation networks, the Internet of Things and related network requirements and solutions for industrial applications, as well as the policies and contributions required for effective security management. This year's conference introduces two special sessions on the role of emerging technologies in the arts and culture, with virtual reality and digital twins providing a new way to interact with art and heritage in a virtual world. Similarly, the video demonstration track provides an online demonstration of the latest in applied research on future networks, augmented reality and virtual reality, machine learning, healthcare and cybersecurity. The conference also aides in understanding how ITU's work on standardization could play a role in a post-pandemic world. I would like to express my great appreciation to the Kaleidoscope community and the larger ITU Academia membership for their enduring support to this series of conferences. With over 160 academic and research institutes now members of ITU, the Kaleidoscope series is certain to continue growing in strength. My sincerest thanks go to our technical co-sponsors, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the IEEE Communications Society (IEEE ComSoc). I would also like to thank our academic partners and longstanding ITU members, Waseda University, the Institute of Image Electronics Engineers of Japan (I.I.E.E.J.), the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE) of Japan, the Chair of Communication and Distributed Systems at RWTH Aachen University, the European Academy for Standardization (EURAS), as well as the University of the Basque Country and the Liverpool John Moores University.
