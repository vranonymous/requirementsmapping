abstract = {Software practitioners use various requirement elicitation methods to produce a well-defined product. These methods impact the software product’s eventual traits and target a particular audience segment. Virtual Reality(VR) products are no different from this influence. With the notable rise in product offerings across various domains, VR has become an essential technology for the future. Nevertheless, the type of methods practiced for requirement elicitation still has not been thoroughly studied. This paper presents a mapping study on requirement elicitation methods practiced by VR practitioners in academia and industry. We consolidated our observations based on their popularity in the practitioner community. Further, we present our insights on the necessary and sufficient conditions to conduct VR requirement elicitation using the identified methods to benefit the VR practitioner community.},

abstract = {Recognition of human behaviours including body motions and facial expressions plays a significant role in human-centric software engineering. However, due to the data and computation intensive nature of human behaviour recognition through video analytics, expensive powerful machines are often required, which could hinder the research and application in human-centric software engineering. To address such an issue, this paper proposes a cost-effective human behaviour recognition system named Edge4Real which can be easily deployed in an edge computing environment with commodity machines. Compared with existing centralised solutions, Edge4Real has three major advantages including cost-effectiveness, easy-to-use, and real-time. Specifically, Edge4Real adopts a distributed architecture where components such as motion capturing, human behaviour recognition, data decoding and extraction, and the application of the recognition result, can be deployed on separated end devices and edge nodes in an edge computing environment. Using a virtual reality application which can capture a user's motion and translate into the motion of a 3D avatar in real time, we successfully validate the effectiveness of the system and demonstrate its promising value to the research and application of human-centric software engineering.

The comparison of results along different sessions would facilitate the assessment of patients' improvements.

abstract = {Heterogeneity of embedded systems leads to the development of variable software, such as software product lines. From such a family of programs, stakeholders select the specific variant that satisfies their functional requirements. However, different functionality exposes different non-functional properties of these variants. Especially in the embedded-system domain, non-functional requirements are vital, because resources are scarce. Hence, when selecting an appropriate variant, we have to fulfill also non-functional requirements. Since more systems are interconnected, the challenge is to find a variant that additionally satisfies global nonfunctional (or quality) requirements. In this paper, we advert the problem of achieving interoperability of non-functional requirements among multiple interacting systems using a real-world scenario. Furthermore, we show an approach to find optimal variants for multiple systems that reduces computation effort by means of a stepwise configuration process.},

abstract = {Tour guiding plays an important role in turning sightseeing tours into memorable experiences. Tour guides, especially inexperienced ones, must practice intensively to perfect their craft. It is key that guides acquire knowledge about sights, in-situ presentation skills, and perfection ability to interact with and engage tourists. Therefore, tour-guide education requires on-site training at the place of interest including live tourist audiences. However, for modest budgets, such setups are costly and tourism students have to practice tour guiding at home or in simulated class-room setups. It has become a challenge for students to adequately prepare themselves for jobs in terms of relevant knowledge and skills. To tackle this problem, we propose 360TourGuiding, a VR system enabling its users to practice tour guiding with 360 travel videos plus the attendance of remote audiences participating through their mobile and personal device. This paper reports on the concept, on our design, current implementation, and on a pilot study with the current 360TourGuiding prototype. Based on qualitative feedback gained through the pilot study, we discuss possible system improvements, future system updates, and plans for empirical evaluation.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is an emerging technique that provides immersive experience for users. Due to the high computation cost of rendering real-time animation twice (for both eyes) and the resource limitation of wearable devices, VR applications often face performance bottlenecks and performance optimization plays an important role in VR software development. Performance optimizations of VR applications can be very different from those in traditional software as VR involves more elements such as graphics rendering and real-time animation. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on 183 real-world performance optimizations from 45 VR software projects. In particular, we manually categorized the optimizations into 11 categories, and applied static analysis to identify how they affect different life-cycle phases of VR applications. Furthermore, we studied the complexity and design / behavior effects of performance optimizations, and how optimizations are different between large organizational software projects and smaller personal software projects. Our major findings include: (1) graphics simplification (24.0%), rendering optimization (16.9%), language / API optimization (15.3%), heap avoidance (14.8%), and value caching (12.0%) are the most common categories of performance optimization in VR applications; (2) game logic updates (30.4%) and before-scene initialization (20.0%) are the most common life-cycle phases affected by performance issues; (3) 45.9% of the optimizations have behavior and design effects and 39.3% of the optimizations are systematic changes; (4) the distributions of optimization classes are very different between organizational VR projects and personal VR projects.},

Unfortunately, just like most technologies, user-centered research methods do not directly account for differing motor and communication abilities. This paper synthesizes SCI literature and leverages our own experiences in three research projects spanning five years with SCI users to highlight significant challenges that HCI researchers might face while employing user-centered methods with this population; communication disabilities, motor disabilities, and difficult contextual or environmental factors can make it difficult or impossible to use standard HCI methods when working with SCI users. We conclude with a set of guidelines and challenges for the HCI community to consider, which can be used both when evaluating papers that work with this population, and to fuel development of new methods or approaches that better-serve them.},

Our findings show limited engagement of the care ecosystem in the design, development and user studies of current technologies, and shortcomings in designing for multiple ecosystem stakeholders, despite their crucial role.

abstract = {With the invention of new interaction devices and the requirements for ubiquitous access to application systems, user's interactions have moved beyond the desktop and evolved into a trend of ongoing development. The context in which the application is being used becomes an integral part of the activity carried out with the system. The inclusion of context-awareness provides convenience and efficiency to users for their ubiquitous access. Traditional human-computer interface (HCI) theories are now inadequate for developing these context-aware applications, as we believe that the notion of context should be extended to different categories: computing contexts, user contexts, and physical contexts for ubiquitous computing. This demands a new paradigm for system requirements elicitation and design in order to make good use of such extended context information. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for the elicitation of context-aware requirements and the matching of context-awareness features to the target context by capability matching. Based on this model, we analyze the design issues of some common ubiquitous access situations and show how to fit them systematically into a context-aware application by considering the requirements of a ubiquitous tourist application.},

abstract = {Works around stroke rehabilitation devices have largely focused on improving their performance to aid in physical training. By providing better physical training for patients, it allows them to quickly achieve adequate autonomy in life. However, this leaves little development in their aesthetics, potentially failing to address the impact on patients’ self-integrity. This paper proposes the aesthetic development of an immersive multi-sensorial stroke rehabilitation system, entitled MIDAS (Multisensorial Immersive Dynamic Autonomous System), based on the improvement of self-affirmation of aesthetic products. MIDAS consists of three subsystems, a hand exoskeleton, a Virtual Reality (VR), and an Olfactory subsystem. The functional requirement of the system and the design language of the VR subsystem were used as the basis for the aesthetic framework for the rest of the subsystems. The outcomes were a hand exoskeleton with a minimalist linkage system paired with an organic casing, and an olfactory device with a rounded form attached to a frameless face-shield.},

year = {2015},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Designers of self-adaptive systems often formulate adaptive design decisions, making unrealistic or myopic assumptions about the system's requirements and environment. The decisions taken during this formulation are crucial for satisfying requirements. In environments which are characterized by uncertainty and dynamism, deviation from these assumptions is the norm and may trigger "surprises". Our method allows designers to make explicit links between the possible emergence of surprises, risks and design trade-offs. The method can be used to explore the design decisions for self-adaptive systems and choose among decisions that better fulfil (or rather partially fulfil) non-functional requirements and address their trade-offs. The analysis can also provide designers with valuable input for refining the adaptation decisions to balance, for example, resilience (i.e. satisfiability of non-functional requirements and their trade-offs) and stability (i.e. minimizing the frequency of adaptation). The objective is to provide designers of self-adaptive systems with a basis for multi-dimensional what-if analysis to revise and improve the understanding of the environment and its effect on non-functional requirements and thereafter decision-making. We have applied the method to a wireless sensor network for flood prediction. The application shows that the method gives rise to questions that were not explicitly asked before at design-time and assists designers in the process of risk-aware, what-if and trade-off analysis.},

abstract = {High-fidelity driving simulators can act as testbeds for designing in-vehicle interfaces or validating the safety of novel driver assistance features. In this system paper, we develop and validate the safety of a mixed reality driving simulator system that enables us to superimpose virtual objects and events into the view of participants engaging in real-world driving in unmodified vehicles. To this end, we have validated the mixed reality system for basic driver cockpit and low-speed driving tasks, comparing the use of the system with non-headset and with the headset driving conditions, to ensure that participants behave and perform similarly using this system as they would otherwise. This paper outlines the operational procedures and protocols for using such systems for cockpit tasks (like using the parking brake, reading the instrument panel, and turn signaling) as well as basic low-speed driving exercises (such as steering around corners, weaving around obstacles, and stopping at a fixed line) in ways that are safe, effective, and lead to accurate, repeatable data collection about behavioral responses in real-world driving tasks.},

abstract = {Transient behavior occurs when a running software system changes from one steady-state to another. In microservice systems, such disruptions can, for example, be caused by continuous deployment, self-adaptation, and various failures. Although transient behavior could be captured in non-functional requirements, little is known of how that is handled in practice. Our objective was to study how architects and engineers approach runtime disruptions, which challenges they face, whether or not they specify transient behavior, and how currently employed tools and methods can be improved. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five experienced practitioners from major companies in Germany. We found that a big challenge in the industry is a lack of awareness of transient behavior by software stakeholders. Consequently, they often do not consider specifying it in non-functional requirements. Additionally, better tooling is needed to reduce the effort of analyzing transient behavior. We present two prototypes that we developed corresponding to these findings to improve the current situation. Beyond that, the insights we present can serve as pointers for interesting research directions for other researchers.},

The proposal defines the knowledge management flow as an element that interacts with part workflows and provides rules and actions in the BPMN elements in order to improve the BPM. To achieve the aim, first, a survey was made in forty Colombian' companies in order to identify the state of the practice about business process management, knowledge management and their use through the workflows; then, different elements were identified and characterized in order to achieve the integration model proposed. This was experimented in forty business workflows of the companies analyzed. A use case shows how the interactions among model elements are, and how these can improve the process performance. This experience allowed to measuring the effect that the integration had in the business process management by means of a new metric that involve the knowledge management in the workflow. Finally, it was possible conclude that the knowledge management must be part to the BPM impacting directly the workflow, in order to improve the result offered to the organizational actors and customers.},

abstract = {A major challenge in teaching use-case modeling (UCM) is to mitigate the difficulties of students that prevent them from producing use-case models with quality. The strategies for UCM are scattered in the literature in several areas, and may not be known to the students, who therefore fail to receive the benefits that would mitigate their difficulties. This paper aims to present a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify, gather and analyze strategies for UCM. During the SLR, two thousand two hundred sixty-six studies published between 2008 and 2018 were returned from 6 bases (ACM, IEEE, Scopus, Science Direct, SpringerLink and Engineering Village), which resulted in the selection of 39 primary studies. These were classified, following the coding procedures of Grounded Theory, into 13 categories of different strategies for UCM. The results can help teachers in the adoption of the most appropriate UCM strategies for their students. Besides, they provide a quick reference for teachers and researchers interested in conducting additional studies on teaching strategies for UCM.},

We set out an alternate vision for a new kind of software development environment inspired by recent results from Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE). Given an input program that satisfies the functional requirements, the proposed programming environment will automatically generate a set of candidate program implementations, all of which share functionality, but each of which differ in their non-functional trade offs. The software designer navigates this diverse Pareto surface of candidate implementations, gaining insight into the trade offs and selecting solutions for different platforms and environments, thereby stretching beyond the reach of current compiler technologies. Rather than having to focus on the details required to manage complex, inter-related and conflicting, non-functional trade offs, the designer is thus freed to explore, to understand, to control and to decide rather than to construct.},

Since the control part is not deeply considered in the early design phase of manufacturing system, it often takes much time to create or to modify when the method of process is changed. The test run to verify the control logic is fulfilled in the constructed line, and it sometimes takes severe damages on facilities or human resources. Therefore the PLC simulation is getting more important recently. For the PLC Simulation, the counterpart model (Plant Model) to the PLC is necessary to model the virtual devices. Regarding the forward engineering principle, this paper proposes modeling approach which enables to create PLC code and Plant model for PLC simulation. With the careful investigation about the PLC code and the Plant model, the paper shows three important factors for manufacturing system design, such as hierarchical device structure, possible states for each device, and the process sequence in each station unit.},

abstract = {While software is becoming more complex everyday, the requirements on its behavior are not getting any easier to satisfy. An application should offer a certain quality of service, adapt to the current environmental conditions and withstand runtime variations that were simply unpredictable during the design phase. To tackle this complexity, control theory has been proposed as a technique for managing software's dynamic behavior, obviating the need for human intervention. Control-theoretical solutions, however, are either tailored for the specific application or do not handle the complexity of multiple interacting components and multiple goals. In this paper, we develop an automated control synthesis methodology that takes, as input, the configurable software components (or knobs) and the goals to be achieved. Our approach automatically constructs a control system that manages the specified knobs and guarantees the goals are met. These claims are backed up by experimental studies on three different software applications, where we show how the proposed automated approach handles the complexity of multiple knobs and objectives.},

abstract = {Medical sector is one of the important domains in current society. This paper focuses on the patient treatment processes, in case of requiring prosthesis implantation. The specificity of such a process is that it makes connections between two lifecycles belonging to medical and engineering domains respectively. This implies several collaborative actions between stakeholders from heterogeneous disciplines. However, several problems of communication and knowledge sharing may occur because of the variety of semantic used and the specific business practices in each domain. In this context, this paper is interested in the potential of knowledge engineering and product lifecycle management approaches to cope with the above problems. To do so, a conceptual framework is proposed for the analysis of links between the disease (medical domain) and the prosthesis (engineering domain) lifecycles. Based on this analysis, a combined KM-PLM based approach is proposed. The application of the proposition is demonstrated through an implementation of useful function in the AUDROS PLM software.},

That implies a difficulty for the students when they try to assimilate those concepts because in many cases they cannot make mental associations between the idea and a real image. With the development and use of new learning techniques such as visual learning, the assimilation of these software measurement concepts could be facilitate by the use of a more intuitive way than traditional resources, improving learning results and in consequence academic results. To validate this hypothesis, CuBIT Software Measurement Laboratory developed a software functional size visual course and carried out an experiment at the University of Alcal\'{a}, Spain, comparing the traditional teaching methods with the use of these visual learning techniques. The results of this experiment, presented in this paper, indicate that the use of visual learning techniques could improve the learning process.},

abstract = {Multi-agent systems can be viewed as organisations of individual agents. Designing an agent organisation is a complex process involving defining the structural relationships among agents, the lines of inter-agent communication, and the agent functionality. Existing approaches to agent organisation design are difficult to apply in practice since they require designers to make decisions while working at a low level of abstraction.This paper contributes towards designing agent organisations in a practical and effective manner by proposing to semi-automate the organisational design process. The proposed semi-automatic approach enables agent system designers to reason at a high abstraction level and conveniently re-use previous design decisions. This semi-automatic approach to agent organisation design uses role modelling and a role algebra which captures a number of basic relations among roles. The role algebra's semantics are formally defined using a two-sorted algebra.The applicability of the semi-automatic agent organisation design approach is demonstrated by an example drawn from a case study involving telephone repair service teams.},

abstract = {Early pathogen processes of Alzheimer´s dementia (AD) develop years before the time of diagnosis. The process starts in hippocampal regions, which play an important role in spatial cognitive abilities including spatial memory. The decrease of these abilities leads to deficits in orientation and navigation and has a high impact on everyday live. A simple, fast and exact evaluation of the spatial memory impairment could help to detect the disease at an early stage (e.g. during a regular screening) and could thus enable stopping or slowing down the process. This work aims at the development of such a screening tool by combining a version of the established Smith-Milner paradigm (SMP) [26, 27] for analysis of spatial-cognitive deficits with the technical possibilities of the augmented-reality (AR) technology. A new AR-application was developed and the user acceptance was evaluated with a first group of healthy subjects (N = 40). The user interface of the AR application was specifically tailored for easy use by older participants and non-technical physicians.},

abstract = {Crosscutting concerns degrade software quality. Before we can modularize the crosscutting concerns in our programs to increase software quality, we must first be able to find them. Unfortunately, accurately locating the code related to a concern is difficult, and without proper metrics, determining how much the concern is crosscutting is impossible. We propose a systematic methodology for identifying which code is related to which concern, and a suite of metrics for quantifying the amount of crosscutting code. Our concern identification and assignment guidelines resolve some of the ambiguity issues encountered by other researchers. We applied this approach to systematically identify all the requirement concerns in a 13,531 line program. We found that 95% of the concerns were crosscutting - indicating a significant potential for improving modularity - and that our metrics were better able to determine which concerns would benefit the most from reengineering.},

abstract = {Force feedback has not been fully explored in modern gaming environments where a gamepad is the main interface. We developed various game interaction scenarios where force feedback through the thumbstick of the gamepad can be effective, and categorized them into five themes. We built a haptic device and control system that can support all presented interactions. The resulting device, FS-Pad, has sufficient fidelity to be used as a haptic game interaction design tool. To verify the presented interactions and effectiveness of the FS-Pad, we conducted a user study with game players, developers, and designers. The subjects used an FS-Pad while playing a demo game and were then interviewed. Their feedback revealed the actual needs for the presented interactions as well as insight into the potential design of game interactions when applying FS-Pad.},

abstract = {With network slicing technology, 5G changes the classical mobile network business model from a network-operator-oriented business to a more open system with multiple stakeholders. In this context, a network slice broker plays the role of agency between network resource providers and vertical service providers, to lease and provide on-demand network slice services. In practice, a single network slice broker normally owns limited types of network slices. And a collaboration infrastructure could be built up to enable network slice sharing among multiple network slice brokers, so as to improve user experience, and enhance the resource utilization rate. However, a major challenge with such an infrastructure is how to support fair and secure slice trading process among multiple un-trusted network slice providers. Blockchain technology, on the other side, brings in high opportunities to implement a fair and secure trading system without a trusted third-party. In view of this observation, this paper proposes a design of blockchain-enabled collaboration infrastructure for network slice brokers, where a group of registered brokers can trade their network slices in a fair and secure manner. To enhance the accountability of slice trading records, transactions are verified and sorted by each broker node, which are further packed into blocks and appended to a shared ledger maintained by each member in the collaboration network. More specifically, we design a Proof-of-Majority (PoM) consensus protocol to sort slice trading transactions before packing transaction blocks of the shared ledger. Furthermore, an optimization for the basic PoM protocol is discussed, with dependency resolving strategy to improve system performance. Experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of our proposal.},

abstract = {The growth of the video game market, the large proportion of games targeting mobile devices or streaming services, and the increasing complexity of video games trigger the availability of video game-specific tools to assess performance and maintainability problems. This paper proposes UnityLinter, a static analysis tool that supports Unity video game developers to detect seven types of bad smells we have identified as relevant in video game development. Such smell types pertain to performance, maintainability and incorrect behavior problems. After having defined the smells by analyzing the existing literature and discussion forums, we have assessed their relevance with a survey involving 68 participants. Then, we have analyzed the occurrence of the studied smells in 100 open-source Unity projects, and also assessed UnityLinter's accuracy. Results of our empirical investigation indicate that developers well-received performance- and behavior-related issues, while some maintainability issues are more controversial. UnityLinter is, in general, accurate enough in detecting smells (86%-100% precision and 50%-100% recall), and our study shows that the studied smell types occur in 39%-97% of the analyzed projects.},

abstract = {Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has led to an unprecedented development in almost all areas of human life. It forms the basis for what is called "the cognitive revolution" -- a fundamental change in the way we communicate, feel, think and learn based on an extension of individual information processing capacities by communication with other people through technology. This so-called "extended cognition" shapes human relations in a radically new way. It is accompanied by a decrease of shared attention and affective presence within closely related groups. This weakens the deepest and most important bonds, that used to shape human identity. Sustainability, both environmental and social (economic, technological, political and cultural) is one of the most important issues of our time. In connection with "extended cognition" we have identified a new, basic type of social sustainability that everyone takes for granted, and which we claim is in danger due to our changed ways of communication. We base our conclusion on a detailed analysis of the current state of the practice and observed trends. The contribution of our article consists of identifying cognitive sustainability and explaining its central role for all other aspects of sustainability, showing how it relates to the cognitive revolution, its opportunities and challenges. Complex social structures with different degrees of proximity have always functioned as mechanisms behind belongingness and identity. To create a long-term cognitive sustainability, we need to rethink and design new communication technologies that support differentiated and complex social relationships.},

abstract = {Design structure measures are example of a class of metrics that may be derived early on in a software project; they are useful indicators of design weaknesses - weaknesses which, if uncorrected, lead to problems of implementation, reliability and maintainability. Unfortunately, structure metrics are limited in their ability to model system architecture since they are insensitive to component size. Thus, architectures that trade structural complexity for very large components may not be detected. This paper has two concerns. First, we consider the problem of adequately measuring component size at design time. Various existing metrics are evaluated and found to be deficient. Consequently, a new, more flexible approach based upon the traceability from system requirements to design components, is proposed. Second, we address the issue of multi-dimensional modelling (in this case structure and size). We apply outlier analysis techniques to identify three classes of problem design component and relate our work to an empirical study of 62 modules. The results suggest that augmenting the more traditional approach of a single structure metric with an additional perspective, that of module size, considerably enhances the ability of design metrics to isolate problem components. It is our belief that far more sophisticated software modelling techniques, such as the multi-dimensional approach we present, are required, if measurement and modelling is to reach its full potential, as an integral part of software engineering processes.},

abstract = {Airborne software systems play very important roles in modern civil aircraft systems, and there are several safety standards, including DO-178B/C, etc., that are compulsory to be satisfied before airborne software can be certificated by the authority of government. According to the DO-178B/C, the consistency and integrity of airborne software requirements must be analyzed and verified in the early stage of software development. In this paper, we introduce a formal modeling and analysis tool platform (ART: Avionics Requirement Tools) for airborne software natural language requirements, and a case study of the requirements of the software subsystem of the Indication-Recording System (IRS) is provided. Firstly, we give the semantics of a formal Variable Relationship Model (VRM), the platform architecture, and toolchain of ART. Then a methodology of formal analysis of requirement consistency and integrity based on a multi-paradigm is given. After that, some details of the case study of IRS are shown including: how to make a preproccessing of original requirements and the automatic analysis process of the requirement model, such as the preprocessing and standardization of original requirement items, automatic generation of VRM models and multi-paradigm based formal analysis, etc. Lastly, some experiences of this case study are shown.},

abstract = {We advocate for a novel paradigm in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). As a technology, it has evolved to a scalable networking paradigm with minimalistic operational mandates. However, inherited design principles of static functionality, that are pre-determined at design stage, hinder WSN evolvement. More importantly, while we design WSNs to endure harsh environments and scale in both urban and remote settings, we neglect two major factors. The over-deployment of WSNs renders many sensing nodes redundant in functionality, and inflates the cost of running applications; not to mention the resulting medium contention. In this paper we present a novel approach to expanding the operational scale of WSNs by adapting to the environment in which it is deployed. That is, capitalizing on an organic approach in thriving on available resources in the region of interest to reduce deployment cost, and solicit incentivized interaction among communicating resources to deliver dynamic sensing. Not only does this span a new dimension of reliability, over garnered resources, but presents a novel approach to assigning sensing tasks to available resources in correlation to their abundance and serviceability. We present our performance evaluation of reduction in operational costs, and the uptake of sensing tasks by neighboring resources via extensive simulations. We aim to benchmark WSN operational versatility and present a rigorous basis for evaluating the ability of WSNs to resiliently scale to new applications as well as handle intermittent and permanent failures.},

abstract = {With the increasing richness of people's cultural life, the density of learning gymnastics, dance, fitness and other sports activities gradually increase, and more and more users will pay more attention to the accomplishment of dance art and exercise of gymnastics. However, owing to the improper practice, many students have muscle strain, ligament tear, dislocation of muscles and bones and other injuries, which may need a long-term recovery at later stage, and some injuries may even last a lifetime to influence the physical and mental health of students. Therefore, the author makes user cards, finds and concludes user pain points, excavates function requirements, and uses KJ analysis methods, KANO model to establish product function model through researches on user background based on the study of TRIZ theory. The user problems are solved and the function requirements are realized through the exploration and application of TRIZ theory, matter-field model analysis and other methods, so as to explore the practice method conductive to students, design the exoskeleton robot as dance realia, and provide scientific and effective auxiliary training and safety protection for users.It is crucial to improve the quality of dance, gymnastics and other sports education.},

abstract = {A design methodology based on simulation of dynamical behavior is presented in this paper. The particularity of our method is that it exploits the set-membership simulation. Indeed, this method allows one to consider an interval of values for each parameter of the dynamical model. Finding the parameters validating the requirements is then a filter, based on a Branch and Prune algorithm. We prefer an approach of appropriate design that is a design which validates the physical constraints coming from requirements, to an optimal design which does not lead to satisfy imperative requirements. Our method is described and applied on the complex problem of design of an hovercraft under dynamic requirements.},

abstract = {Metaverse has received a huge attention in recent times with several Big Techs having invested in this concept. Accenture defines the metaverse as “an evolution of the Internet that enables a user to move beyond ‘browsing’ to ‘inhabiting’ in a persistent, shared experience that spans the spectrum of our real world to the fully virtual and in between”. The evolution that Metaverse brings can be seen along three dimensions: 1) shift towards spatial experiences: which includes 2D, 3D, augmented, virtual, and mixed reality immersive experiences, 2) shared co-presence: where users experience a persistent shared space with a sense of co-presence with others, and 3) trusted identities and transactions to address challenges of fake identities, products, and transactions as present in today’s internet. For example, a retail marketplace, on Metaverse could be seen as an immersive spatial experience where users can shop along with their families and friends who join virtually in the same environment. The sense of shared co-presence gives them the ability to discuss about products in real time and persistency gives them ability to come back to the same space. This evolution opens an enormous opportunity to rethink the digital experiences future applications would offer to the people. AI would be the core engine behind making these experiences richer, immersive, and engaging. The role of AI, in the Metaverse, is broad; however, in this tutorial, we will focus on two areas where AI will play a major role in shaping up the form and function of the Metaverse by: 1) bringing more realism in Metaverse with high fidelity immersive content generated through AI techniques and 2) enhancing user interactions by bringing more intelligence in the interaction modes.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of the "missing requirements" in software requirement specification (SRS) expressed in natural language. Due to rapid changes in technology and business frequently witnessed over time, the original SRS documents often experience the problems of missing, not available, and hard-to-locate requirements. One of the flaws in earlier solutions to this problem has no consideration for missing requirements from multiple viewpoints. Furthermore, since such SRS documents represent an incomplete domain model, manual discovery (identification and incorporation) of missing requirements is highly labor intensive and error-prone. Consequently, deriving and improving an efficient adaptation of SRS changes remain a complex problem. In this paper, we present a new methodology entitled "Proxy Viewpoints Model-based Requirements Discovery (PVRD)". Through the requirements discovery and analysis process, PVRD methodology provides ways to construct proxy viewpoints model from legacy status requirements. Requirements term expansion technique facilitates the retrieval process of requirements of interest based on the improved requirements representation space in proxy viewpoints model. The PVRD methodology provides an integrated environment that supports requirements discovery process as well as efficient management.},

abstract = {The problem of space debris represents a major topic of concern in astronomy as the threat of space junk continues to grow, and the accuracy of its tracking is greatly restricted by the insufficiency and limitations of current surveillance sensors. This article presents the development of an open-source, high-performance, signal-level radar simulator to assist in modelling the detection and tracking of space debris from terrestrial radar stations, including multistatic installations where the transmitter and receiver may be separated by many kilometers. This tool is expected to aid astronomers and researchers in space situational awareness, supporting the modelling of radar interactions in this context and simulation-based exploration of radar designs for space surveillance. It makes use of an accelerated orbit propagation technique with measured two-line element datasets being used to define space debris objects. The software has been named the Space Object Astrodynamics and Radar Simulator – or SOARS – and both the transmitted and received signals generated by the application have been shown to agree with theoretical expectations. Additionally, SOARS is presently undergoing continued development, extension and optimization for heterogeneous computing platforms, enabling the use of the NVIDIA® Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) interface. Results have demonstrated promising speed-ups in simulation runtimes when using the CUDA version of the application over the original sequential version, even on lower-end graphics processors. It is anticipated that the developed application will be used for the design and testing of radar sensors for space situational awareness applications, as well as for use in research, teaching and training environments.},

Our proposed analysis methodology determines qualitative numbers between best-case and worst-case of system properties and quantifies them with probabilities. For this issue, we combine local coarse-grained profiling and formal system-level analysis models in a hybrid approach for an early quantitative determination of qualitative system properties. Our approach considers the control-flow of communicating processes and the impact of blocking communication instances on the temporal behavior of the entire system during formal analysis. This can be used for determining the global system performance. The application of our new methodology leads to an inclusion of probabilities concerning system properties and allows an early performance risk estimation of a design with regard to predefined system requirements and constraints.},

abstract = {Cloud-based, adaptive applications such as video streaming and interactive cloud gaming are important to existing 4G and emerging 5G and beyond networks, as they attract a large number of users and bring significant revenues to both carriers and application service providers. These applications are also known to consume significant cellular network resources. To maintain good quality-of-experience (QoE) while minimizing network resource consumption, these applications employ adaptive mechanisms based on the changing network condition. Although various methods have been deployed to convey network information to applications running on user equipment (UEs) or cloud servers, the existing mechanisms are limited in generality and flexibility. In this paper, we propose MoWIE (Mobile and Wireless Information Exposure), a framework that uses systematic, flexible information channels to decide "what" information to expose between networks and applications and advocate an integrated in-band and out-band transport to realize "how" exposed information can be provided to applications with adaptive information exposure rate optimization. We conduct three case studies over real-world operational networks - through collaboration between one of the largest application developers and one of the largest cellular carriers in the world. These case studies, while still preliminary and ongoing, illuminate the potential benefits of systematic, adaptive network information exposure in mobile networks. We conclude by discussing remaining important yet challenging issues in implementing and deploying MoWIE in practice.},

abstract = {The software engineering community has proposed numerous approaches for making software self-adaptive. These approaches take inspiration from machine learning and control theory, constructing software that monitors and modifies its own behavior to meet goals. Control theory, in particular, has received considerable attention as it represents a general methodology for creating adaptive systems. Control-theoretical software implementations, however, tend to be ad hoc. While such solutions often work in practice, it is difficult to understand and reason about the desired properties and behavior of the resulting adaptive software and its controller.This paper discusses a control design process for software systems which enables automatic analysis and synthesis of a controller that is guaranteed to have the desired properties and behavior. The paper documents the process and illustrates its use in an example that walks through all necessary steps for self-adaptive controller synthesis.},

abstract = {Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is the key enabler for emerging intelligent transportation systems. Applications built on top of V2X require both authentication and privacy protection for the vehicles. The common approach to meet both requirements is to use pseudonyms which are short-term identities. However, both industrial standards and state-of-the-art research are not designed for resource-constrained environments. In addition, they make a strong assumption about the security of the vehicle's on-board computation units. In this paper, we propose a lightweight auto-refreshing pseudonym protocol (LARP) for V2X. LARP supports efficient operations for resource-constrained devices, and provides security even when parts of the vehicle are compromised. We provide formal security proof showing that the protocol is secure. We conduct experiments on a Raspberry Pi 4. The results demonstrate that LARP is feasible and practical.},

abstract = {Software quality and reliability is a primary concern for successful development organizations. Monitoring and controlling quality by helping developers detect as many faults as possible is a subjective and intricate approach. Due to the inherent difficulties and limitations, additional methods are required to obtain a more complete solution to the software quality problem. This paper analyzes the software quality problem from a different perspective involving a step back from faults to focus on the fundamental causes of faults. The first step in this direction is the application of the Error Abstraction Process (EAP) to the requirements phase of the software lifecycle to develop a Requirement Error Taxonomy (RET). This paper presents an empirical study on the application of the EAP and RET to requirement documents in a controlled classroom setting. The results show that the EAP significantly improves the productivity of subjects, that the RET is useful for improving software quality, that it provides useful insights into the requirements document, and that various context variables also impact the results. These results are promising and are important to motivate further investigation, to refine the RET, and to derive more formalized tools and methods for assisting developers. The result of this investigation will be a sound verification process for requirements phase.},

In this paper, we propose Spartacus, a mobile system that enables spatially-aware neighboring device interactions with zero prior configuration. Using built-in microphones and speakers on commodity mobile devices, Spartacus uses a novel acoustic technique based on the Doppler effect to enable users to accurately initiate an interaction with a neighboring device through a pointing gesture. To enable truly spontaneous interactions on energy-constrained mobile devices, Spartacus uses a continuous audio-based lower-power listening mechanism to trigger the gesture detection service. This eliminates the need for any manual action by the user. Experimental results show that Spartacus achieves an average 90% device selection accuracy within 3m for most interaction scenarios. Our energy consumption evaluations show that, Spartacus achieves about 4X lower energy consumption than WiFi Direct and 5.5X lower than the latest Bluetooth 4.0 protocols.},

abstract = {How early technology requirements are formed for animals involves asking humans caring for the animal to give requirements for them. For zoo animals, this is the keeper and other experts who work with the animal. This requirement gathering process is used as a method of forming user-centric designs for systems for animals. Yet little attention has been paid towards how to form these early requirements in zoos or whom to gather these from. Addressing this, we investigate how to construct technology requirements for the zoo housed animals, using white-faced saki monkeys as an instance. Utilizing the method of questionnaires, we gather requirements from zoo keepers and zoo visitors. Comparing and analyzing our results, we reveal how requirements for animal-technology in zoo contexts diverge and intersect. Our data indicates that these vantages mostly align; with the zoo visitors focusing upon the aesthetics and keepers concentrating on practicalities. Overarching these, we note how requirements in proxy for animals often involves a synthesis of complex motivations, user narratives, vantage points, and prior technology and animal experience that is irreparably intertwined within the requirement process. This paper builds upon requirement gathering methods for unconventional users.},
